MatTek tissues have unparalleled reproducibility and multiple regulatory acceptances and validations from organizations like the OECD, ISO, and US EPA to predict the irritation, corrosion, and photosensitivity potential of chemical, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and other skin care products. Our EpiDerm and EpiOcular models are validated by OECD as an alternative to animal testing, Skin irritation test OECD TG 439, skin corrosion test OECD TG 431, phototoxicity OECD TG 498, eye irritation test OECD TG 492, and biological evaluation of medical devices, ISO 10993-23. At the present time, MatTek IVLSL produces 8 models including EpiDerm, EpiDerm FT, EpiOcular, EpiIntestinal, EpiIntestinal FT, EpiAirway, EpiOral, and MelanoDerm. MatTek tissues are shipped weekly from its locations in the US and Europe via standard courier services and delivered ready to use with comprehensive testing results obtained in as little as 24 hours. With a footprint, a fraction of the size of animal testing, MatTek’s tissue technology offers a sustainable, streamlined testing option with reduced costs and timelines. In fulfillment of its mission to expand the accessibility of lab-grown human tissues, MatTek continues to grow its product offerings at all locations and enhance the complexity of existing organ models through robust R&D. MatTek also supports researchers adopting the technology with comprehensive training and the highest-rated technical support in the industry. By providing a platform to obtain human-relevant data that is predictive of clinical outcomes, MatTek is helping researchers achieve their goals of producing reliable products and therapies for consumers and patients.|Skin irritation, skin corrosion, UV exposure, DNA damage, permeability|Skin irritation, corrosion, hydration, dermal drug delivery, phototoxicity, dermal genotoxicity, epidermal differentiation|high|Toxicity|https://www.mattek.com/mattekproduct/epiderm/|Scientific literature/ handouts|Validated by OECD TG 431, 439|
