| |NCT06468527|Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Dirocaftor/Posenacaftor/Nesolicaftor in Adults With CF| CFTR modulators and their combinations were tested on organoids from over 500 European and Israeli CF patients with rare CFTR mutations to identify patients who are predicted to clinically benefit from these treatments. |
| |NCT03390985|Canadian Observation Trial in CF Patients Undergoing Treatment With Ivacaftor|To establish correlation between the CFTR response to Vx-770 measured in a new ex vivo method (organoids) and the actual clinical and/or functional response in individual patients,|
| |NCT05100823|Validation of Therapeutic Efficacy Targeting the Splicing Variants in Cystic Fibrosis and CFTR Pathologies|assessment of ONB (named ONB-CFTR) various CFTR genotypes will be performed using an air-liquid interface model of airway epithelium|
