Combining high quality data from robust in vitro Micro Electrode Array (MEA) assays and a unique LASER technology, we enable the recording of intracellular action potentials, adding value and relevance to the toxicity data supplied to our customers in the field of basic research and pharmaceutical industries. The core technology is a patented, non-invasive method for the recording of cell’s action potentials by means of cell poration with a laser-based technique. Our method exploits a laser system to open nanopores in the cardiac cells’ membrane, thus allowing for the precise recording of intracellular action potentials and the short term (or acute) detection of drug-related adverse reactions on the cell’s membrane ion channels. Furthermore, the extremely low-invasiveness of our technology allows, for the first time, the long-term (or chronic) assessment of in-vitro cardiac toxicity, providing the most precise electrophysiological assay on human-derived cardiac cells available on market with the goal to reduce development costs for drugs and dramatically increase safety.|Michele Dipalo, https://www.linkedin.com/in/michele-dipalo-b2353458/, Giovanni Melle, https://www.linkedin.com/in/michele-dipalo-b2353458/, info@foreseebiosystems.com|Heart|
