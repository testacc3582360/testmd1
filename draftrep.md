**Background**

The Indian pharmaceutical industry is projected to expand to 150-200
billion USD in the next decade contributing significantly to the global
supply of pharmaceutical drugs. “*India ranks as the 13th largest
pharmaceutical market by value and the third largest by volume globally.
It supplies over 20% of the global generic medicines market and accounts
for more than 60% of the world’s vaccines*.”

- The recent “Policy to Catalyse R&D and Innovation in the Pharma
  MedTech Sector in India” aims to encourage R&D in pharmaceuticals and
  medical devices along with creating an ecosystem for innovation to
  enable in order India to become leader in drug discovery and
  innovative medical devices.<sup>5</sup>

With a rising trend towards innovation in the pharmaceutical sector in
the country, it is envisaged that preclinical testing will also
subsequently increase for NCEs/NBEs, generics, biosimilars, cell and
gene therapy etc.

Animal testing also has long been the standard for preclinical drug
development, yet these models often fail to recapitulate the complexity
of human biological systems specifically in the context of
organ-specific toxicity and disease-specific responses. The animal
models fail to recapitulate the complexity of human system due to
species-specific difference in physiology, metabolism and
genetics between animals and human which leads to discrepancies in data.
This leads to high failure rates in clinical trials and significant
delays in bringing safe and effective therapies to market. Only about
10% of drugs progress from Phase I trials to regulatory approval. To
address these limitations, the global scientific and regulatory
landscape is rapidly shifting toward Non-Animal Methods which includes
technologies like organ-on- chip, organoids and in silico models. The
period from 2022 onwards has witnessed a turning point in drug
development with the recent adoption of the FDA Modernization Act 2.0 in
the USA which authorises the use of non-animal methods to assess the
safety and efficacy of drugs.

Besides issues of human relevance and ethical reasons, the cost of
animal research is high—in dollars, leading to delays in drug approval,
and in the loss of potentially beneficial drugs for human use. Globally,
the non-animal models have also been shown to provide economic benefits,
providing remarkable business opportunities Thus, it is essential to map
potential opportunities for 3Rs – (refine, reduce and replace, with key
focus on the latter two) within New Trials and Drugs Rules, 2019,
comparing it to the global regulations like European Medical Agency
guidelines, key reflection papers, Food & Drugs Administration, USA
guidance documents and International Council for Harmonisation of
Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH)
guidelines.

India has taken a stance towards new emerging technologies that
human-relevant with the recent amendment that has been introduced to the
New Drugs and Clinical Trial Rules (2023), which allows the use of
non-animal and human-based methods like 3D organoids, organs-on-chip,
and advanced computational methods, for testing safety and efficacy of
new drugs.  Considering this pivotal step by the Indian regulatory body,
this report aims to map and identify non-animal technologies that may
have potential to be adopted into the India ecosystem, as well as
provide recommendations to develop and facilitate their adoption by the
pharma industry.

The year long analysis was undertaken by four key organizations viz Dr.
Reddy’s Laboratories, DBT- InSTEM, Humane World for Animals India and
Animal Law and Policy Network to assess various 3R opportunities across,
generics, biosimilars, cell and gene therapy, NCEs/NBEs and provide a
landscape view of the emerging non-animal technologies. With the
governance structure of a steering committee, the project was divided
across different verticals with specific focus (Figure 1).

**Figure 1:** Structure of the entire project including details
regarding specific verticals

Process of data collection was based on a rigorous process as referring
to more than 300 publications, more than 100 company websites and
consultation with more than 30 national and international stakeholders
as shown in Figure 2a & 2b.

diverse kinds of stakeholders consulted (b)

**Scope of the project:**

A qualitative assessment was done for various 3R opportunities across
different sectors and opportunities were designated as very high, high,
moderate and low.

- **Biosimilars and generics:** With India being a key player in the
  generics and biosimilars space, this domain presents opportunities for
  3Rs especially for reduction and waiver opportunities when NDCT rules,
  2019 are compared to global regulations.

- **NCE & Biologics:** While opportunities to reduce usage of animals as
  per global regulations exist- as India is developing very few
  molecules, the impact from these two domains may not be drastic.
  However, this scenario may undergo a shift in the future considering
  the country’s emphasis on innovation. Opportunities for introduction
  of NAMS exist at CROs which cater to the global market engaged in
  innovation

- **Cell and gene therapy:** With India approving the first home grown
  gene therapy in India, potential exists in this domain. While scope
  exists for 3Rs, CGT is still an emerging field in the country

- **Vaccines:** India has emerged as a key bulk vaccine manufacturer and
  contributes to nearly 60 percent of the world's vaccines. In the
  recent decades, several in vitro methods have been developed to test
  the safety and potency of vaccines during the batch testing process.
  In this sector, we document the in vitro methods that have been
  accepted by regulatory bodies and also the methods that are currently
  in the process of validation during the batch testing of vaccines.

- **Cross-sectoral tests: Pyrogen testing**: The detection of pyrogens
  is a critical step for assuring the quality and safety of parental
  pharmaceuticals and medical devices. In this sector, we document and
  analysis the key non-animal technologies to detect pyrogens and
  endotoxins, namely Monocyte Activation Test (MAT) and the recombinant
  Factor C assay (rFC), and provide recommendations to enable the
  adoption of these tests in India.

**Figure 3: Qualitative assessment of 3R opportunities across different
sectors**

**Methodology to assess technologies in different sectors:**

**Regulatory space - Generics, Biosimilars, Cell and Gene Therapy,
NCEs/NBEs, Vaccines batch release testing, Pyrogen testing:** For
vertical 1, to identify potential opportunities for waiver, reduction
and replacement of animals during the drug development process, a
detailed assessment of non clinical studies listed in New Drugs and
Clinical Trials, 2019 was carried out.  Comparative assessment with
International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for
Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) guidelines, FDA guidance documents
and European Medicines Agency guidelines was done. Independent documents
were also referred by FDA and EMA. For cell and gene therapy, a detailed
assessment of national guidelines on gene therapy product development &
clinical trials was done. Comparative assessment of such studies was
done with the recent released guideline on quality, non-clinical and
clinical requirements for investigational advanced therapy medicinal
products in clinical trials by EMA and FDA guidelines<sup>4</sup>   

Besides covering the regulatory space, few opportunities were also
mapped in the non regulatory space for generics, NCEs/NBEs based on
consultation with stakeholders.

**Analysis of global landscape of emerging non animal methodologies for
drug development:** A detailed list of major industry players in NAMs
was created after curating the websites of global industry players which
was validated by multiple stakeholders (e.g.,pharmaceutical companies,
Contract Research Organizations (CROs), academicians and researchers and
toxicologists). NAMs based on their application to specific tissues or
organs such as the liver, heart, skin, eye, kidney, intestine, lungs and
nervous system were listed.The list includes information on whether the
model is 2D, 3D or *in silico*, the type of cells or materials used, and
the *invitro* endpoints measured. We have classified these NAMs based on
their technology readiness level (TRL) considering i) their complexity
of adoption ii) their overall impact including cost efficiency,
reduction in animal usage iii) status of their approval by regulatory
agencies and iv) their scalability and usage. Recommendations
(specifically in an Indian context) for the adoption of NAMs were made
after consulting with the various stakeholders.

| Endotoxin Test | LAL (but recombinant methids accepted as Alternative in the new Draft Guidelines) | rFC/Accepted as Compendial in Eu Ph and Alternative in USP | To be accepted as Alternate/Compendial in IP |

**Key Next Step:** Work with pharma companies, especially Dr Reddy Labs
to submit validation data to IPC for rFC and MAT; and work towards the
incorporation of these tests in IPC. Work with govt./biotech companies
for setting up indigenous supply chin to manufacture reagents, PBMCs,
buffers to reduce the cost of these tests.

**Key recommendations**

· An industrial consortium can be formed to lead for the implementation
of 3Rs during drug development and adoption of *in silico, in vitro* and
Generative AI approaches for the reduction of animal usage.

· Leveraging organizations like Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA) to
encourage many pharmaceutical companies to reduce their dependence on
animal testing by making them aware of the potential cost-savings that
the shift could entail.

**Emerging global landscape for non animal methodologies and key
recommendations**

For verticals 2 and 3, we analyzed the key global industry player in
NAMs. Based on our analysis of the 122 evaluated NAMs, the NAMs related
to liver toxicity have the highest technological readiness level.
Notably, Liver-on-chip from Emulate Bio is part of the FDA’s Innovative
Science and Technology Approaches for New Drugs (ISTAND) Pilot Program
and is in the advanced stage of evaluation and approval. However, no
NAMs have currently received full regulatory acceptance. Therefore, at
this stage, no opportunities are identified for waiver of toxicology
studies. Our analysis of the 124 NAMs revealed that the highest number
of NAMs are utilized for studying dermal toxicity (23) and hepatic
toxicity (26). In addition to these, NAMs are also employed for toxicity
assessments of other tissues, including ocular, renal, respiratory,
intestinal, central nervous system (CNS), and cardiac toxicity (Figure
1).

![](./media/image9.emf)

**Fig 4:** Bar graph showing the number of industry players in NAMs in
different tissue-specific toxicity testing

The liver NAMs are classified as high TRL since they have high impact in
terms of cost and animal reduction and they are widely being used by
pharma companies and CROs. For example, the liver-on-chip model by
Emulate Bio is part of the FDA’s Innovative Science and Technology
Approaches for New Drugs (ISTAND) Pilot Program while InSphero’s 3D
liver spheroids have been utilized in collaboration with the U. S. FDA
for liver toxicity studies. These advanced TRL liver NAMs are
particularly valuable for assessing hepatotoxicity and drug-induced
liver injury (DILI), offering significant potential for integration into
drug development processes within the Indian pharmaceutical sector.
Therefore, we recommend the adoption of these high TRL liver NAMs in the
Indian pharmaceutical context. Apart from the liver, NAMs with lower
TRL, particularly for the kidney, lungs and heart require urgent focus.
Technologies such as 2D *in vitro* cell culture models for lungs, 2D
iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes and *in silico* cardiotoxicity prediction
tools have low complexity of adoption and high impact in terms of cost
reduction. Therefore, the Indian pharma industry should move towards
adopting these NAMs in future.

**Key Recommendations for adoption of NAMs:**

1.  Development of indigenous biobanks for validating human cells,
    including liver cells like HepG2 and primary hepatocytes.

2.  Indigenous manufacturing of cell culture media, reagents, and
    labware to reduce costs and logistical barriers.

3.  Conducting capacity-building programs such as training, workshops,
    and stakeholder engagement events.

4.  Leveraging public-private partnerships and government funding from
    agencies like DBT, BIRAC, and CSIR.

5.  Expanding use of in-silico tools (e.g., GastroPlus, DILIsym) in
    regulatory submissions and internal decision-making.

6.  Adopting high-TRL NAMs (especially liver-on-chip) in early-stage
    drug discovery.

Although full replacement of animal models is not yet feasible NAMs
present a strong opportunity for reduction especially in hepatic,
dermal, respiratory and cardiac toxicity assessments. With appropriate
investments in infrastructure, training and validation, NAMs can reduce
dependency on animal testing.

**Ecosystem level recommendations:** **The Three Ecosystems
Approach**[^1]

This report deals primarily with three different ecosystems with each
ecosystem being composed of a diverse set of stakeholders.

1.  **Ecosystem 1:** Sectors where there are clearly available 3R
    opportunities (generics, biosimilars, cell and gene therapies,
    vaccines, NCEs and NBEs).

2.  **Ecosystem 2:** Drug development sector (NAMs).

3.  **Ecosystem 3:** Post-release sector (MAT, rCR and rFC).

Ecosystem level recommendations for each of these three are likely to
vary significantly.

**Ecosystem 1: Sectors with existing 3R opportunities**

**Key stakeholders in Ecosystem 1:**

<img src="./media/image10.png"
style="width:6.26772in;height:2.31944in" />

Fig 1. Key Stakeholders in Ecosystem 1

**Key recommendations:**

1.  Creation of an **industry consortium** to bring together key
    industry players in these sectors to collectively advocate for the
    3Rs.

The consortium will have the following **functions**:

1.  Awareness generation about the benefits of moving away from animal
    testing: reduction of costs; increased ability to invest in more
    human-relevant research methods; etc. within the pharmaceutical
    industry. For instance, the U.S. NTP Interagency Center for the
    Evaluation of Alternative Toxicological Methods (NICEATM) conducts
    workshops and webinars on the 3Rs approach.[^2]

2.  Focus on creating more awareness about 3R opportunities within the
    pharmaceutical industry in India by collating and disseminating best
    practices that have already been/can be adopted to reduce the number
    of animal tests.

3.  Leverage the Indian Pharmaceutical Association (IPA) to encourage
    more and more pharmaceutical companies to reduce their dependence on
    animal testing by making them aware of the potential cost-savings
    that the shift could entail.

4.  Collectively approach regulators to advocate for reduction and
    replacement opportunities by seeking meetings, submitting
    representations, and inviting them to workshops and webinars
    organised by the Consortium.

<!-- -->

2.  Civil society groups (like Humane World for Animals) could advocate
    for greater data transparency from agencies like the Committee for
    Control and Supervision of Experiments on Animals (CCSEA) as far as
    the extent and nature of experimentation on animals is concerned.

> The availability of this data will help shape public opinion and
> thereby create more public pressure on the pharmaceutical industry as
> well as regulators to explore and utilise the available 3R
> opportunities.

**Ecosystem 2: Drug development sector (NAMs)**

Fig 3. Overall representation of Key Ecosystem Recommendations

High level changes are also required in the ecosystem to facilitate
development of NAMS

These would include:

1.  **Set up Centres of Excellence (CoEs) based on a hub and spoke
    model.**

**Objective:** To spur research and innovation in order to indigenously
develop NAMs technologies.

**Rationale:**

Establishing dedicated Centres of Excellence (CoEs) can accelerate the
development and adoption of NAMs by offering specialised infrastructure,
training, and validation services.

In the proposed CoE, the following iteration of the Hub and Spoke Model
is proposed:

**Central Hub (Core CoE):**

State‐of‐the‐art resources: Large‐scale laboratories equipped with
high‐throughput screening systems, organ‐on‐chip devices, and data
repositories. The hub could define research agendas, manage
collaborations (with industry, academia, regulators), and ensure quality
control.

**Spoke Institutions (Specialised Labs):**

1.  Research and innovation spokes: Located in IITs or national labs
    focusing on specialised NAMs research, e.g., computational
    toxicology.

2.  Training and education spokes: Offer workshops, certification
    courses, and skill development programs for both academic and
    industry professionals.

**2.Establish a Consortium to catalyse the development and subsequent
adoption of NAMs.**

**Objective:** To bring together various stakeholders in the NAMs
ecosystem on one common platform and catalyse development and adoption
of NAMs.

**Rationale:**

Globally, Consortiums have played a significant role in propelling NAMs
technologies further. (Example: International Consortium for Innovation
and Quality in Pharmaceutical Development (IQMPS)). In its roadmap to
accelerate the maturation of NAMs in the country, Australia has also
proposed setting up of a Consortium.

**3. Establish a Central Agency for NAMs.**

**Objective:** To facilitate greater adoption of NAMs by the industry
and CROs by working closely with regulators to create frameworks
essential for NAMs adoption.

**Rationale:**

The FDA’s proposed central NAMs office represents a strategic shift from
a fragmented approach towards methodical validation and implementation
with respect to NAMs.

**Ecosystem 3: Post-release sector (MAT, rCR and rFC)**

**Key stakeholders in Ecosystem 3:**

<img src="./media/image13.png"
style="width:6.26772in;height:3.26389in" />

Fig 5. Key Stakeholders for Post-Release

**Key recommendations:**

1.  Awareness generation within the pharmaceutical industry about the
    availability and benefits of alternatives to Rabbit Pyrogen Test and
    Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate (LAL) test through workshops and webinars.
    This function can be performed by the Consortia that have been
    recommended as part of Ecosystems 1 and 2.

2.  Even though the Indian Pharmacopoeia (IP) General chapter for
    Monocyte Activation Test was introduced in IP 2018: 2.2.25​, detailed
    guidelines from the IP on how it can be used by the pharmaceutical
    industry could propel greater adoption of this technology. This
    function can be performed by the Consortia that have been
    recommended as part of Ecosystems 1 and 2.

3.  Production of indigenous reagents associated with the rFC, rCR, and
    MAT tests to reduce the costs of adoption by the industry
    (pharmaceutical companies and CROs).

4.  Ensuring a continuous supply chain for the kits/reagents.

Documentation of the global standardisation efforts of these tests: As
standardisation of the assays, including the types that use whole blood
and cell lines for MAT assays, would be essential to reduce the
variability and increase consistency of production. Documenting and
increasing access to the global efforts in this direction, including
guidelines by WHO, EDQM etc. could help in this direction.

5.  Improving adoption of NAMS in the Indian CRO sector via regular
    sensitization programmes, assessing current need via surveys etc.

Objectives of the Study

- Create a roadmap for adopting alternatives to animal experimentation
  for drug development in India.

- Analyse the regulatory landscape in India and globally to identify
  best practices surrounding animal testing and NAMs technologies, that
  can be adopted in India.

- Identify the barriers in India’s regulatory framework and propose
  pathways to adopt NAMs technologies across generics, biosimilars,
  vaccines, new chemical entities (NCEs), new biologic entities (NBEs),
  etc.

- Analyse the efficiency of rFC monocyte activation test (MAT) test over
  the Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) test for pyrogen testing.

- Prepare a prioritised list of existing NAMs technologies upon
  assessing their technological readiness levels and their application
  in tissue-specific toxicity and efficacy studies focusing on their
  strengths, limitations and future potential in transforming the drug
  discovery process.

- Examine the available alternatives to animal experimentation to
  identify 3R opportunities and phase out unnecessary animal testing.
  Map out areas where NAMs technologies can replace animal models.

- Analyse the barriers to adopting alternatives to animal
  experimentation in drug testing to make ecosystem-level
  recommendations to establish a drug development landscape that
  prioritises NAMs technologies over animal models for drug testing. 

**Hypothesis**

> Creating a roadmap for the adoption of alternatives to animal testing
> in the pharmaceutical sector will catalyse their adoption in drug
> development in India. This will consequently enhance accuracy and
> efficiency, ensuring compliance with global standards of drug
> development. The adoption of NAMs technologies such as invitro models,
> in-silico tools, organ-on-chip systems, AI-driven platforms, etc. in
> drug development will help establish India as a global frontrunner in
> drug development. Establishing an ecosystem supportive of NAMs
> technologies will enable an easier transition and build a robust
> ecosystem for pharmaceutical drug development.

  to enter regulatory validation have not been included in the study.

> **3.Generics and Differentiated Drugs **

**Introduction:**

EMA :

As per European Medicines Agency, a generic medicinal product is defined
as a medicinal product that has:

 • the same qualitative and quantitative composition in active
substance(s) as the reference product, 

• the same pharmaceutical form as the reference medicinal product, 

• and whose bioequivalence with the reference medicinal product has been
demonstrated by appropriate bioavailability studies. 

Hybrid medicinal product: A medicine that is similar to an authorised
medicine containing the same active substance, but where there are
certain differences between the two medicines such as in their strength,
indication or pharmaceutical form

FDA

 A generic drug is a medication created to be the same as an already
marketed brand-name drug in dosage form, safety, strength, route of
administration, quality, performance characteristics, and intended use.

Regulatory Scenario

> According to Article 10 (1) of Directive 2001/83/EC the applicant is
> not required to provide the results of pre-clinical tests and clinical

>
> Nonclinical Studies and Their Role in Drug Development
>
> Applicants are required to submit, among other things, nonclinical
> information to support approval of an NDA or BLA. For example, the NDA
> regulations provide that NDAs include data about the drug’s
> pharmacology and disposition (pharmacological effects, including
> mechanism(s) of action; absorption, distribution, metabolism,
> excretion) and toxicology (acute, subacute, and chronic toxicity;
> developmental and reproductive toxicity; carcinogenicity;  and special
> toxicology, as appropriate). 
>
> The NDA regulations note that these data can come from studies
> conducted in animals or in vitro. (FDA Draft Guidance “Generally
> Accepted Scientific Knowledge in Applications for Drug and Biological
> Products: Nonclinical Information Guidance for Industry” 2023,
>
> The nonclinical information described above addresses critical issues

>
> 5\. Identify specific parameters to inform safety in humans 
>
> 6\. Identify the mechanistic understanding of an adverse biological

>
> Relevant regulations do not specify the exact study types and designs

>
> BACKGROUND
>
> Generally, nonclinical data support use of a drug product by a
> particular route and also reflect the planned duration of use. Much of
> the available nonclinical information used to support approval of an
> initial formulation can be used to support the safety of new
> formulations, but in some cases these data may not be sufficient to
> support additional approvals because changes in the formulation could
> produce a new toxicity or more commonly because the new formulation
> will be used in a different way. In those cases, additional
> nonclinical studies might be recommended to ensure that the toxicity

>
> If the new formulation is to be used in a manner similar to previous
> formulations, the need for additional nonclinical data generally will
> be limited. However, if the new formulation will be used in a
> substantially different way (e.g., new route, longer duration), the

>

> adequate by current standards. If this is not the case, and the change

>
> SYSTEMIC TOXICITY CONSIDERATIONS
>
> All routes of administration can result in systemic exposure.
> Therefore, the adequacy of the available systemic toxicity information
> should be evaluated based on a comparison of the systemic exposure
> obtained after administration of a proposed new formulation to the
> systemic exposure with use of the previously approved formulation.
>
> Additional toxicity studies might be recommended if the available
> toxicity information is not sufficient to support the exposure
> associated with the new formulation or route or if a significantly
> different pattern of exposure results from the new formulation or
> route.
>
> An adequate evaluation of the pharmacokinetics and absorption,
> distribution, metabolism, and elimination (PK/ADME) of the drug
> substance is recommended for new formulations
>
> For all drug product reformulations and for all drug products with new
> routes of administration, acute and/or repeat-dose toxicity studies
> with complete histological evaluation should be conducted using the
> clinical route of administration. Acute studies may not be needed when
> repeat-dose studies are conducted. Note that as with systemic
> toxicity, new studies may not be needed if existing information is
> already sufficient

> **4. New Chemical Entities and New Biological Entities**

**Current scenario in India**

While a huge network of pharma companies exists in the country coupled
with many scientists and researchers skilled in the drug development
space; India lags behind in the development of New Chemical Entity
(NCE)/ New Biologics entities when compared to USA and Europe.1 This is
reconfirmed by the fact that India ranked 39th out of 133 economies in
the Global Innovation Index 2024. <sup>2</sup>

Drug discovery is generally a “high risk and high reward” space and many
Indian pharmaceutical companies have conventionally made low investments
in NCE R&D due to the high cost, and longer time. Other contributory
factors could be a strong industry−academia collaboration which could be
a hurdle to innovative drug discovery and development. Moreover, there
is ready dominance of key international players like Pfizer, Novartis,
Roche, Eli Lilly and Bristol Myers Squibb.  
While such factors are operational, a report by Bain and company
recently reported that India’s top 10 players have a robust pipeline
comprising over 40 NCEs/NBEs, signaling a strong push toward
innovation<sup>3</sup>

**Newer policy interventions can transform the innovation landscape**

The Indian industry needs to be made relevant by expanding into New
Molecular Entities space which accounts for 2/3rd of global value pool
and where India has currently small presence today.<sup>4</sup> With the
introduction of “Policy to Catalyse R&D and Innovation in the Pharma
MedTech Sector in India” prepared to encourage R&D in pharmaceuticals
and medical devices alongwith creating an ecosystem for innovation to
enable in order India to become leader in drug discovery and innovative
medical devices; this scenario may undergo a transformation in the next
decade.<sup>5</sup> The Indian pharmaceutical industry is the 3rd
largest pharmaceutical industry in the world by volume with current
market size of around USD 50 Billions. It is estimated that the industry
could potentially grow to USD 120-130 Billion over the next decade; one
of the key drivers for this growth being expansion of the industry’s
presence in the innovation space.<sup>5</sup> One of the key priority
areas for research in the policy include Novel Chemical Entities.

**Potential opportunities for 3Rs – New Drugs and Clinical Trials Rules,
2019 and global regulatory requirements**

With a rising trend towards innovation in the coming years in the
country, it is envisaged that preclinical testing will also subsequently
increase for NCEs/NBEs. Thus, it is essential to map potential
opportunities for 3Rs within New Trials and Drugs Rules, 20196 comparing
it to the global regulations like European Medical Agency guidelines and
reflection papers<sup>7-8</sup>, Food & Drugs Administration, USA
guidance documents and International Council for Harmonisation of
Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH)
guidelines<sup>9</sup>. Considering that India has taken a stance
towards welfare of animals with the recent amendment that has been
introduced to the New Drugs and Clinical Trial Rules (2023), passed by
the Government of India, to replace the use of animals in research, with
non-animal and human-relevant methods like 3D organoids, organs-on-chip,
and advanced computational methods, for testing safety and efficacy of
new drugs; scope of introducing amendments to the NDCT rules, 2019 for
waiver and reduction opportunities for NCEs/NBEs also exists.

**Intensive growth of the CRO sector in India offers great potential for
NAMS**

The CRO sector in India is growing @ CAGR 10.75 % which is expected to
reach USD 2.5 Billion by 2030. The CRO sector is driven by specialized
research and development service providers assisting pharmaceutical and
biotechnology companies in drug discovery and development programs.
These include discovery CROs, pre-clinical CROs, clinical CROs and the
CROs offering bioequivalence and bioavailability services.<sup>10</sup>

Global pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies adhering to global
regulations like FDA and EMA often outsource specific services to CROs
to leverage their specialized expertise and infrastructure. There is
thus a great potential to introducing non animal methodologies at these
CROs.

**Methodology:** To identify potential opportunities for waiver,
reduction and replacement of animals during the drug development
process**,** a detailed assessment of non clinical studies listed in New
Drugs and Clinical Trials, 2019 was carried out. Comparative assessment
with International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements
for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) guidelines, FDA guidance
documents and European Medicines Agency guidelines was done. Independent
documents were also referred by FDA and EMA. <sup>11</sup> For eg:
[<u>Reflection paper providing an overview of the current regulatory
testing requirements for medicinal products for human use and
opportunities for implementation of the
3Rs</u>](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/scientific-guideline/reflection-paper-providing-overview-current-regulatory-testing-requirements-medicinal-products-human-use-and-opportunities-implementation-3rs-first_en.pdf)

**Opportunity assessment for waiver, reduction and replacement of
animals:**

**Opportunities for waiver – Single Dose toxicity studies**

As per NDCT Rules 2019, single dose toxicity studies should be carried
out in 2 rodent species (mice and rats) using the same route as intended
for humans. (Table 1) In addition, unless the intended route of
administration in humans is only intravenous, at least one more route
should be used in one of the species to ensure systemic absorption of
the drug**.**

**Global regulatory requirements on single dose toxicity studies**

The ICH guidance for acute toxicity assessment is the “Guidance on
Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and
Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals M3(R2)” <sup>12</sup>
indicates that data needed to assess acute toxicity can be obtained from
repeated-dose toxicity studies. Usually, submission of multi-dose rather
than single-dose animal studies are done as multi-dose studies can be
used to support multi-dose clinical trials and marketing a product for
even a single dose in humans, per ICH M3(R2). ICH guideline on
Preclinical Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology-Derived Pharmaceuticals
S6(R1) (ICH, 1997/2011) also suggests that obtaining acute toxicity
information from studies other than single dose studies and lethality
tests can be done. <sup>13</sup>

Earlier, FDA used to receive single-dose toxicity information to support
single-dose clinical trials in humans, but it does not recommend
conducting such studies when toxicity information is already available
(from other countries or regions) or will be available from multi-dose
studies. FDA advises against the conduct of lethality tests and
considers any other single dose studies unnecessary.

The FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research is in agreement that
acute systemic toxicity data are not needed during the development of
pharmaceuticals. The CDER therefore does not request nonclinical acute
systemic toxicity data.<sup>14</sup>

FDA CBER (Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research) follows ICH
guidelines although FDA’s adherence to these guidance documents is not
mandatory. CBER regulates biological products for human use which are
not regulated by Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, such as
vaccines, blood and blood products, allergenics, cellular and tissue
products, and gene therapies. CBER does not regulate monoclonal
antibodies for therapeutic use, proteins for therapeutic use,
immunomodulators, or products intended to alter the production of
hematopoietic cells *in vivo.*

In Europe as well, following discussions within the Safety Working Party
of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, it was agreed to
remove the guideline on single dose toxicity. The decision was based
mainly on the same fact that data obtained in traditional single dose
toxicity studies have limited value and that information on acute
toxicity can be obtained in other types of toxicity studies which would
also contribute towards animal welfare.<sup>15</sup>

The change in regulations has been supported by evidence from studies
like the one in Europe which surveyed 18 pharmaceutical companies and
CROs to determine how acute toxicity studies that included lethality
were used in the industry to support the development of traditional
pharmaceuticals.<sup>16</sup> The authors found that acute toxicity
studies were no longer the first studies conducted on pharmaceuticals
and that acute toxicity data were not used to support dose selection for
repeated-dose studies in animals or for the first clinical trials in
humans.  The conclusions were discussed and agreed with representatives
of regulatory bodies from the US, Japan and Europe.

**Key recommendation:** Considering key global regulatory changes,
single dose toxicity studies may not be required to be carried out
independently and can be part of repeated dose toxicity studies in
India. Thus, there could be a provision of waiving off such studies when
multi dose studies have been planned.

**Opportunities for reduction:**

**Repeated Dose toxicity Studies:**

Repeat-dose toxicity studies are carried out to evaluate adverse effects
  of compounds when administered to the experimental animals repeatedly
for a period of time. The duration of repeat-dose studies can be short
(e.g., daily dose for up to 14 days), subchronic (up to 3 months), or
chronic (longer than 3 months and usually up to 2 years). 

**India scenario:**

As per NDCT Rules, 2019 these studies should be carried out in at least
two mammalian species, of which one should be a non-rodent. Dose ranging
studies should precede the 14-, 28-, 90- or 180- day toxicity studies.
Duration of the final systematic toxicity study would depend on the
duration, therapeutic indication and scale of the proposed clinical
trial. If a species is known to metabolise the drug in the same way as
humans it becomes pharmacologically relevant and should be preferred for
toxicity studies.

**Opportunities post assessment of Global regulatory requirements:**
Following

opportunities exist for repeat dose toxicity studies with regard to:

1.  Reduction :

- Restricting the number of species

- Combining other studies as part of repeat dose toxicity studies

2.  Refinement

> Shortening to duration for certain studies

**Reduction opportunities - Restricting number of species on a case to
case basis**

Short- and long-term repeat-dose toxicology assessments of experimental
therapeutic molecules are generally conducted in both a rodent and a
non-rodent species, consistent with existing regulatory guidance.
Exceptions exist, particularly for some biologics which can be
applicable in India:

- **When similar target organ toxicity profiles are identified in short
  term toxicology studies (4 weeks) and long term toxicology studies
  (the 13, 26 or 39 weeks) are to be designed:** For biotherapeutic
  molecules that are pharmacologically active in both a rodent and a
  non-rodent species, **ICH S6(R1) provides** an opportunity to reduce
  to a single species (preferably rodent) for long-term toxicology
  studies, where scientifically justified, largely based on similarity
  of toxicity findings identified in each of the two species from early,
  typically FIH-enabling, toxicology studies. 

- **Assessing pharmacological relevance**

> **a.Studies involving monoclonal antibodies:** Due to the high
> selectivity of biologics, often only one pharmacologically relevant
> species can be identified which is usually the non-human primate
> (NHP), (because of higher sequence homology between the human and NHP
> proteome). Consequently, single species toxicology packages for
> biologics have been relatively common and widely
> accepted.<sup>17</sup>
>
> **b.Anticancer immunotherapies:** There are few published examples of
> nonclinical programmes with no animal toxicology data, particularly
> for
> anti-cancer [<u>immunotherapies</u>](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/immunotherapy) ,
> where no relevant toxicology species were identified.<sup>18, 19</sup>
>
> **c. For small molecules:** In certain circumstances, determined on a
> case-by-case basis, alternative approaches can be appropriate (e.g.,
> for genotoxic drugs targeting rapidly dividing cells, a repeat dose
> toxicity study in one rodent species might be considered sufficient,
> provided the rodent is a relevant species. <sup>20</sup>
>
> **d. Other drug modalities like oligonucleotides:** Some drug
> modalities, such as oligonucleotides and other peptides, span the
> small molecule and biologics space but often follow ICH M3(R2)
> guidance, and chronic studies are performed in two species, including
> a 9-month duration study for the non-rodent. Some oligonucleotides
> have successfully justified single-species programs based on
> pharmacological relevance,<sup>  </sup>more flexibility towards **ICH
> S6(R1)** rather than **ICH M3(R2)** approaches for these molecule
> types may be justified, <sup>21, 22</sup>

**Key recommendation:**

- Based on currently existing regulations and few studies, use of single
  species for different modalities could be opportunities for potential
  adoption which currently fall outside the remit of repeat dose
  toxicity studies under NDCT Rules, 2019.

**b. Combining studies with repeated dose toxicity studies to reduce
animal usage:**

> ICHMR2 states that consideration should be given to inclusion of any
> *in vivo* evaluations as additions to general toxicity studies, to the
> extent feasible, in order to reduce animal use.

These could include the following studies:

1.  **Genotoxicity studies:** If genotoxicity endpoints are to be
    incorporated into a general toxicity study, then an appropriate
    maximum dose should be selected based on a MFD, MTD or limit dose of
    1000 mg/kg/day.

2.  **Safety pharmacology studies:** Animal use may be reduced by
    replacing standalone safety pharmacology studies with integrated
    toxicology studies, which is consistent with current ICH guidance
    (ICH, 2009). When such studies are combined, about 20–40% reduction
    in animal use may be observed.

> While this is a common approach during the development of biologics
> and anti-cancer therapeutics, many companies are reluctant to
> implement this approach for other types of drugs without evidence that
> regulators will accept it in practice. This is based on the impact of
> possible confounding factors, such as the influence of

> overcome by multiple phase studies that firstly assess safety

>
> (\*In addition to the essential safety pharmacological studies,
> additional supplemental and followup safety pharmacology studies may
> need to be conducted as appropriate in India which are in accordance
> with ICH Guidelines)

3.  **Local tolerance studies:** It is preferable to evaluate local
    tolerance by the intended therapeutic route as part of the general
    toxicity studies; stand alone studies are generally not recommended
    as per ICHM3R2. Further details about these studies would be
    discussed in forthcoming section.

> **General toxicity studies**

**Refinement – Shortening duration of study**

1.  **Shortening duration of study from 9 to 6 months in non-rodents:**

>  Small molecules and other drugs such as oligonucleotides and peptides
> that generally follow ICH M3(R2) guidance<sup> </sup> are usually
> required to provide data from two species (a rodent and a non-rodent)
> following dosing for 6 months in rodent or 9 months in non-rodent. A

> within the EU, although this is not standard practice.
>
> A reduction in study duration in non-rodents from 9 to 6 months is an
> important consideration to discuss across the industry in EU, with
> opportunities to refine study designs allowing a shorter period on
> study for the animals involved. Secondary wins would be reduced use of
> test compounds, cost savings and time savings. <sup>24</sup>

2.  **Shortening duration of toxicity studies for monoclonal Abs from 6
    to 3 months**: To support registration of  monoclonal (mAbs) for
    chronic indications, 6-month toxicity studies have historically been
    conducted. Experience with mAb development has shown a relatively
    benign and well-understood safety profile for this class, with most
    toxicity findings anticipated based on pharmacology. Evaluation
    whether a 6-month toxicity study is necessary to assess the
    long-term safety of mAbs. Data on First-in-Human (FIH)-enabling
    and [<u>chronic toxicity
    studies</u>](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/chronic-toxicity-study) were
    shared for 142 mAbs submitted by 11 companies. Opportunities to
    further optimize study designs to reduce animal usage were
    identified. For 71% of mAbs, no toxicities or no new toxicities were
    noted in chronic studies compared to FIH-enabling study findings.
    New toxicities of potential concern for human safety or that changed
    trial design were identified in 13.5% of cases, with 7% being
    considered critical and 2% leading to program termination. An
    iterative, weight-of-evidence model which considers factors that
    influence the overall risk for a mAb to cause toxicity was
    developed. This model enables an evidence-based justification,
    suggesting when 3-month toxicity studies are likely sufficient to
    support late-stage clinical development and registration for some
    mAbs.<sup>25</sup>

3.  <sup> </sup>**For molecules intended for advanced cancer
    indications** following ICH S9 guidance,<sup> </sup> dosing
    durations of 3 months in a rodent and a non-rodent species are
    generally considered sufficient.

**Female reproduction and developmental toxicity (DART) studies:** As
per NDCT Rules, 2019, these studies need to be carried out for all drugs
proposed to be studied or used in women of child bearing age. Segment I,
II and III studies (Table 3) are to be performed in albino mice or rats,
and segment II study should include albino rabbits also as a second test
species. On the occasion, when the test article is not compatible with
the rabbit (e.g. antibiotics which are effective against gram positive,
anaerobic organisms and protozoas) the Segment II data in the mouse may
be substituted.

When compared to ICH S5R3 Guidelines, specific opportunities for 3Rs can
be considered<sup>26</sup>

1.  **Use of same animals in DART testing:** The use of the same species
    and strain as in already completed toxicity studies can eliminate
    the need to use of additional animals or conduct additional studies
    to characterize pharmacokinetics and metabolism, and/or for dose
    range finding.

2.  **For biopharmaceuticals:**

<!-- -->

1.  **FEED studies are not warranted in advanced cancer cases:** Unless
    the biopharmaceutical is intended to treat advanced cancer, in which
    case FEED studies are not warranted, animals should be sexually
    mature at study initiation in order for an adequate evaluation of
    the reproductive tissues to be made.

2.  **Segment II (EFD- Embryofetal development studies in one
    species):**

> -The effect of biopharmaceuticals on EFD should typically be assessed
> in two species (one rodent and one non-rodent) if both are
> pharmacologically relevant. However, the rodent is often not
> pharmacologically relevant, in which case EFD assessment in a single
> pharmacologically relevant non-rodent species can be conducted.
>
> \- Biopharmaceuticals intended for the treatment of advanced cancer
> typically need only be assessed in a single pharmacologically relevant
> species (ICH S9).

3.  **Waiver of EFD studies:** If there are no relevant species,
    genetically modified animals or surrogates available, *in vivo*
    reproductive toxicity testing is not meaningful. In this case, the
    approach used for risk assessment, or rationale for not conducting
    studies, should be justified.

**c. Alternative Approaches for Addressing EFD Risk**

A number of alternative *in vitro,* ex vivo, and non-mammalian *in vivo*
assays (alternative assays) have been developed to detect potential
hazards to embryo-fetal development. They have been used as drug
discovery screens for adverse effects on EFD and have assisted in the
understanding of the mechanism of toxicity, which can be useful for
translating nonclinical data to human risk (especially for
human-specific targets). Continued use of alternative assays for these
purposes is encouraged. If properly qualified, alternative assays have
the potential to defer or replace (in certain circumstances)
conventional *in vivo* studies. This has the added benefit of
potentially reducing animal use

**Local toxicity**—NDCT Rules, 2019: These studies are required when the
new drug is proposed to be used by some special route (other than oral)
in humans. The drug should be applied to an appropriate site (e.g., skin
or vaginal mucous membrane) to determine local effects in a suitable
species. Typical study designs for these studies should include three
dose levels and untreated or vehicle control, preferably use of two
species, and increasing group size with increase in duration of
treatment. While NDCT Rules, 2019 include using alternatives for skin
and eye before initiating experiments on animals, specific opportunities
can be incorporated from EMA guidelines, <sup>27</sup> which are :

**Emphasis on 3Rs:** Guideline on regulatory acceptance of 3R testing
approaches should be consulted before conducting non-clinical studies.
It is recommended that if animal studies are necessary for an evaluation
of local tolerance by the intended clinical route of administration,
such an evaluation is included as part of the general toxicity studies
whenever possible, and not as a “stand-alone” study.

**Inclusion of all in vitro methods**: “Consideration should be given to
internationally validated and regulatory accepted OECD methods as well
as internationally validated methods not yet included in OECD test
guidelines. In vitro methods not having undergone international
validation could be considered, if scientifically justified, on a case
by case basis in a specific context of use (e.g. in a weight-of-evidence
approach).”

**Animal welfare considerations for refinement: “**Animal welfare should
be one of the highest priorities when investigating local tolerance. In
cases where unexpected local intolerance occurs, the experiment should
be terminated before the point where severe adverse reactions are seen
and/or the continuation of the experiment is not expected to provide
results essential for risk assessment.

**Phototoxicity:** As per NDCT Rules, 2019**,** should be tested by
Armstrong or Harber test in guinea pig. This test should be done if the
drug or a metabolite is related to an agent causing photosensitivity or
the nature of action suggests such a potential (e.g., drugs to be used
in treatment of leucoderma).

**ICH Guidelines S10** suggest that to reduce the use of animals in
accordance with the 3R principles, a validated *in vitro* method should
generally be considered before conducting animal testing (see, for
example, Directive 2010/63/EU). If the drug developer chooses an *in
vitro* approach, the 3T3 NRU-PT is currently the most widely used assay
and in many cases could be considered as an initial test for
phototoxicity. The high sensitivity of the 3T3 NRU-PT results in good
negative predictivity and the negative results are generally accepted as
sufficient evidence that a substance is not phototoxic. In such cases no
further testing is recommended and no direct phototoxicity is
anticipated in humans. In some situations (e.g., poorly soluble
compounds), an initial assessment of phototoxicity in an *in vitro*
assay might not be appropriate. In this case, an assessment in animals
or in humans could be considered. Alternatively, if drug distribution
data are available, they could, on a case-by-case basis, support a
decision that no further photosafety assessment is warranted.

**Opportunities for replacement are described in the chapter on
non-animal methodologies, few examples that can be cited here as:**

**Pharmacokinetics:**

1.Non-clinical evaluation of drug-drug interactions is limited to in
vitro investigations as per ICH guideline M12 on drug interaction
studies (EMA/CHMP/ICH/652460/2022).

2\. Complex in vitro systems like Organ-on-Chip (OoC)) have been
developed for ADME and could potentially be used to generate data for a
regulatory submission or a qualification procedure.

**Safety pharmacology:**

1.Integrated test strategy including in vitro tests (e.g. hERG assay)
for assessment of QT interval prolongation (ICH S7B). Increased
predictive capacity of in vitro assays through implementation of best
practices for in vitro IKR/hERG assays, in vitro ventricular
repolarisation assays (e.g. human induced pluripotent stem cell derived
cardiomyocyte assays).

2.EMA is developing regulatory acceptance criteria for qualification of
3Rs proarrhythmic models, including organ-on-chip models, for use as
part of an integrated risk assessment for regulatory purposes. This will
be included in the Guideline on the principles of regulatory acceptance
of 3Rs testing approaches (2)

**Overall recommendations for bringing regulatory transformation for
implementation of 3Rs**

1.  It is important to bridge industry and regulators together via
    workshops, meetings to deliberate on opportunities for 3R in the
    current NDCT Rules, 2019. This effort could begin with formation of
    an industry consortium to take consensus on key opportunities for
    3Rs and then approach regulators.

2.  To accelerate progress in this area, industry champions should be
    identified which assume responsibility for identifying novel methods
    and approaches that have the potential to be accepted by regulators.

- The champion would then lead a group comprised of a number of
  companies who are abreast of the latest science and would provide a
  consensus opinion on appropriate practice.

- This group would also provide a link between industry and regulators
  to enable greater interaction and data-sharing between the two groups.

3.  Post deliberations at a workshop comprising key industry players and
    regulators, amendments to NDCT rules could be envisioned in the form
    of a circular.

**5. Cell and gene therapies**

**Global scenario**

The global cell and gene therapy market size is calculated at USD 25.03
billion in 2025 and is forecasted to reach around USD 117.46 billion by
2034, accelerating at a CAGR of 18.7% from 2025 to 2034.<sup>1</sup>
Various factors attribute to the market growth including the areas of
advanced therapies, gene delivery technologies, progressive competition,
as well as key players focusing on commercialisation of such therapies.

**India’s regulatory framework with respect to Cell and Gene therapy**

Almost a decade ago, the Government of India started its initiative to
develop Cell therapy in India. In 2016, an initiative to accelerate the
application of stem cell technology in human diseases was published. In
the following year of 2017, revised national ethical guidelines for
biomedical & health research, regulations, & guidelines for recombinant
DNA research & biocontainment were published. Then in 2019, national
guidelines on gene therapy product development & clinical trials were
published by Government of India alongwith new drugs & clinical trial
rules.

To initiate, the first approval required is from the Institutional Bio
Safety Committee, followed by a test license NOC from the central
authority & the local state authority. The pre-clinical application is
then submitted to the Review Committee on Genetic Manipulation. Post
approval pre-clinical data is provided followed by clinical trials. For
new developers seeking advice on clinical development, Gene Therapy
Advisory Evaluation Committee is approached which also provides NOC
before initiating clinical trials. After completion of the clinical
phases, the marketing authorization application is submitted to CDSCO
which participates in inspections of that jurisdiction, issuing test
license followed by manufacturing license. Thus, while the RCGM under
the Department of Biotechnology take care of the biosafety level &
animal studies, the Indian Council of Medical Research under the
Ministry of Health & Family Welfare issues the NOC for trials.

It has been encouraging to see India’s first approved cell therapy
become available to patients in 2023. A recent clinical study by
scientists at the Center for Stem Cell Research, Tamil Nadu using gene
therapy with lentiviral-transduced autologous cells for haemophilia-A
showed promising results by restoring factor VIII production in the
patients. Similarly, another indigenous therapy for sickle-cell anaemia
with CRISPR-Cas is progressing in India. Considering that there will be
an increase in development of such therapies in India, current
guidelines may be revised as per global regulations to incorporate a
better 3Rs framework.

Studies focused on different disease areas, ranging from blood cancer to
the more difficult solid cancers, and from anaemia to vision correction,
auto-immune disease, and Parkinson's disease

**Methodology:** To identify potential opportunities for waiver,
reduction and replacement of animals, a detailed assessment of national
guidelines on gene therapy product development & clinical trials was
done. Comparative assessment of such studies was done with the recent
released guideline on quality, non-clinical and clinical requirements
for investigational advanced therapy medicinal products in clinical
trials by EMA and FDA guidelines<sup>4</sup>

**Global regulatory requirements**

In Europe the guideline on quality, non-clinical and clinical
requirements for investigational advanced therapy medicinal products in
clinical trials have been recently released and present the following
opportunities which can be incorporated in the currently existing
guidelines for a better 3Rs framework: <sup>4</sup>

1.  **Case to case basis evaluation of non-clinical program:** The
    non-clinical program can be determined on a case-by-case basis
    depending on the type of respective ATMP, availability of
    appropriate non-clinical models, and the intended clinical use.

> **-** Furthermore, the extent and duration of exposure to the
> investigational ATMP also affects the extent of the non-clinical
> program. For example, if the product is administered locally and/or
> kept isolated by physical or biological means, the need for evaluation
> of systemic effects is reduced.
>
> **-** The risk-based approach may be applied to identify the necessary
> non-clinical data on a case-by-case basis. <sup>5</sup>
>
> **2.Selection of non-clinical models while considering 3Rs**
>
> *In vivo* animal studies should be carefully planned to ensure
> generation of robust and meaningful data while considering the 3Rs
> (reduction, replacement, refinement) principles. Where appropriate,
> animal testing should be replaced by in vitro, ex vivo or in silico
> studies or a combination thereof.
>
> While Indian Guidelines offer a different type of conditional approach
>
> “10.2.1.4. In the event that no specific in vivo disease models are
> available, the GTP can be evaluated by combination studies in suitable
> in vitro disease models and in normal strains of animals based on
> evidence in literature, on a case by case basis.”
>
> **3.Combining toxicology and PK studies:** It is supported to combine
> relevant safety endpoints and biodistribution analysis in a
> proof-of-concept study. Safety data can be collected in toxicology
> studies as well as in proof-of-concept studies conducted in the
> disease model(s) provided that adequate safety endpoints are included.
> *In silico*, *in vitro* and/or *ex vivo* data can be used to
> substitute or supplement *in vivo* animal data. The overall safety
> evaluation should take into account cell persistence and
> biodistribution data. The use of the same animal model in both the
> toxicology investigations and the pharmacokinetic studies may be
> beneficial, as it allows correlation of the biodistribution of the
> investigational ATMP with observed toxicity signals.
>
> Combining such studies is not defined in the National Guidelines.
>
> **4.Conditional basis for selection of large vs small animals:** Small
> animal models such as rodents are often useful and widely employed
> since they are readily available and easy to manipulate. However, if
> extrapolation from small animal models to human becomes challenging
> due to e.g. differences in the body size and anatomy that may preclude
> certain administration procedures and devices in small animal models,
> large animal models may be needed.
>
> EMA guidelines have a conditional rationale for including large
> animals when extrapolation from small animal models becomes
> challenging, while as per National Guidelines both small and large
> animals should be included.
>
> -10.2.2.3. Pharmacokinetics, dose-response-If the GTP is a first of
> its kind developed either for preclinical or clinical use, further
> delineation of biologically active and relevant dose range should be
> done, wherever possible in multiple animal models, preferably
> including both small and large animals”.
>
> -10.2.1.5. For a GTP that is under pre-clinical evaluation for a first
> in clinical use, a tiered preclinical testing paradigm involving
> different assays for efficacy/toxicity documentation and both small
> and large animal models (if available) should be employed to
> characterize the functional attributes of the GTP.
>
> **5. Preference for single species for toxicology studies:** In the
> case that animal studies are conducted, one animal species is
> sufficient if the model is considered predictive. However, multiple
> animal species or strains may be needed to cover all relevant safety
> aspects on a case-by-case basis. Both sexes should be included unless
> justified. A conditional requirement for one conducting animal studies
> in one species is currently not existing in the National Guidelines.
>
> **6. GTP vector choice:**
>
> Multi arm trials to incorporate multiple GTP vectors is mentioned as
> per current national guidelines while this is not included in the EMA
> guidelines
>
> 11.3.2.6. Multi-arm trial designs to compare multiple GTP vectors for
> delivery efficiency or therapeutic efficiency must incorporate in
> depth justification from pre-clinical animal testing in both small and
> large animal models to establish the need for such a design in humans.
>
> **7. Additional toxicity studies:** The need for additional toxicity
> studies e.g. genotoxicity, tumourigenicity, reproductive and
> developmental toxicity, and immunotoxicity studies should be
> determined on a case-by-case basis taking into consideration the risks
> related to the nature and characteristics of the particular class of
> ATMPs and the intended clinical use

**-Genotoxicity studies:** Standard genotoxicity assays are generally
not appropriate for ATMPs.

**- Tumourigenicity:** Standard lifetime rodent carcinogenicity studies
are usually not required. However, depending on the type of product, the
tumourigenic and oncogenic potential shall be investigated in relevant
in vitro/in vivo models for neoplasm signals, oncogene activation or
cell proliferation index.

\- **Reproductive and developmental toxicity:** If effects on
reproductive function and/or development are anticipated, relevant
reproductive and developmental toxicity studies should be conducted
before exposing larger patient populations.

Additional toxicity studies are mentioned in the National guidelines
when there are differences in clinical and preclinical vectors - “If
there are differences between the preclinical and clinical vectors, or
their production process,Additional toxicity studies pertaining to
clinical grade vectors may be required.(10.2.5.2)”

8\. **Conditional waiver of repeat dose toxicity:** Conditional waiver
of repeat dose toxicity can be included in the national guidelines on
cell and gene therapy “Repeat-dose toxicity data are needed to support
multiple administrations in humans. However, a clinical study with
multiple administrations could be initiated without repeat-dose toxicity
data provided that such data are available before multiple dosing in
humans commences. Omission of repeat-dose toxicity studies may be
justifiable if the investigational ATMP has been eliminated from the
body before subsequent administrations (e.g., if the dosing interval is
very long)”. Conditional waiver of repeat dose toxicity can be included
in the national guidelines.

**9. Conditional waiver of safety pharmacology studies:** Safety
pharmacology data are not routinely needed for investigational ATMPs as
per EMA guidelines apart from certain circumstances i.e when potential
effects on major vital physiological functions i.e. cardiovascular,
central nervous system, or respiratory function are anticipated,
appropriate safety pharmacology data should be available before human
exposure. Safety pharmacology endpoints can be incorporated in the
proof-of-concept and /or toxicity studies, if feasible.

**Key recommendations to fast track 3R opportunities in this sector
would include:**

Key opportunities for 3R to be shared with key academicians, CDSCO and
ICMR for incorporating such recommendations in the Revised Guidelines on
cell and gene therapy to be released by CDSCO.

> **6.Biosimilars**

**<u>(Consideration for waiver of in-vivo non-clinical studies’
requirement for Similar Biologics / Biosimilars in India)</u>**

**Background:**

Over the last several years and after the administration of millions of
doses, the world has gained tremendous experience in the development and
use of Biosimilars with no untoward incidences reported anywhere in the
world. The EMA and FDA have approved more than 130 Biosimilar products
till date, none of them have failed animal toxicological testing because
these studies are less sensitive in detecting any difference between a
biosimilar candidate and its reference product (1). Similarly, in India
more than 100 biosimilar products are approved till date, without a
single reported incidence of any biosimilar having failed *in-vivo*
animal toxicology studies over more than 20 years. 

The foundation of biosimilars are supported by ‘totality of evidence’
comprising extensive characterization using orthogonal analytical
methods for physical and structural similarity along with functional
similarity by *in vitro* potency and mechanistic studies. Totality of
evidence demonstrate that the biosimilar active substance is highly
similar to the reference product, and will have the same biological
activity. 

Majority of biosimilars do not elicit pharmacological activities in
non-relevant species like small animals. Hence, are not predictive of
possible toxicity.

Since last few years, Regulatory Authorities worldwide have started
adopting a science and evidence-based approach towards the requirement
of in-vivo non-clinical evaluation. With advent of state of art
analytical tests and extensive analytical similarity exercise for
establishing similarity between the proposed biosimilar and the
reference product analytical similarity exercise is considered more
sensitive to offer more accurate information on the safety and
tolerability of biosimilar candidate than the in-vivo animal based
models. 

Authorities like US-FDA and EMA encourage early discussion on analytical
similarity data and these days have given waiver for conduct of in-vivo
non-clinical studies for many biosimilar products. Authorities like MHRA
and HC clearly state that the non-clinical evaluation using animal
models are not necessary / requested any more. Thus, a congruence in
opinion of all Regulatory authorities worldwide has emerged on the
approach towards preclinical safety evaluation such that these are not
relevant for showing comparability between a proposed biosimilar
candidate and its reference product. 

In this rapidly evolving scientific and regulatory area, there is an
urgent need for reconsideration on requirement of in-vivo non-clinical
studies for Similar Biologics / Biosimilar products in India. 

Current Regulatory Expectation in India:

Guidelines on Similar Biologics: Regulatory Requirements for Marketing
Authorization in India, 2016 (2).

*<u>Data Requirements for Preclinical Studies </u>*

*1. Preclinical Studies (Pharmacodynamic and Toxicology Studies) *

The preclinical studies should be conducted prior to the initiation of
any clinical studies. These preclinical studies should be comparative in
nature and designed to detect differences if any, between the Similar
Biologic and Reference Biologic. The preclinical study design may vary
depending upon the clinical parameters such as therapeutic index, the
type and number of indications applied.

The approach adopted should be fully justified in the preclinical
overview. Preclinical studies should be conducted with the final
formulation of the Similar Biologic intended for clinical use and for
the Reference Biologic unless otherwise justified. The dosage form,
dose, strength and route of administration of the Similar Biologic
should be the same as that of the Reference Biologic and in case of any
differences in these parameters, it should be justified. The following
studies are required for preclinical evaluation:

*2.Pharmacodynamic Studies *

1.  In vitro studies: Comparability of Similar Biologic and Reference
    Biologic should be established by in vitro cell based bioassay (e.g.
    cell proliferation assays /cytotoxicity / neutralizing / receptor
    binding assays). 

<!-- -->

1.  In vivo studies: In vivo evaluation of Biological/ pharmacodynamic
    activity may be dispensable if in vitro assays are available, which
    are known to reliably reflect the clinically relevant
    pharmacodynamic activity of the Reference Biologic. In cases where
    the in-vitro assays do not reflect the pharmacodynamics, In vivo
    studies should be performed, as applicable.

*3. Toxicological Studies *

In case of in vivo toxicity studies, <u>at least one repeat dose
toxicity study in a pharmacologically relevant species is required to be
conducted with an intended route of administration. </u>

Regarding the animal models to be used, the applicant should provide the
scientific justification for the choice of animal model(s) based on the
data available in scientific literature. <u>However, if the
pharmacologically relevant animal species are not available and has been
appropriately justified, toxicity studies need to be undertaken either
in rodent or nonrodent species as per requirements of Schedule Y with
due permission from RCGM</u>. 

Regarding route of administration either in pharmacologically relevant
or pharmacologically non-relevant animal model the route of
administration would include only the intended route as per schedule Y
(now NDCT Rules, 2019)*.*

*4. Immune Responses in Animals *

Antibody response to the Similar Biologic should be compared to that
generated by the reference Biologic in suitable animal model. The test
serum samples should be tested for reaction to host cell proteins. 

For evaluating immune toxicity of the Similar Biologic under study, the
results of local tolerance (part of repeat dose or standalone test)
should be analyzed with the observations regarding immunogenicity in
sub-chronic study. Therefore, the immunogenicity testing should be
included as part of the sub-chronic repeated-dose study while developing
the protocols. 

The other parameters for evaluating immune toxicity include immune
complexes in targeted tissues may be considered while evaluating
histopathology observations, etc. After completion of preclinical
studies, the reports are submitted to RCGM for review and
consideration. 

Other toxicity studies, including safety pharmacology, reproductive
toxicity, mutagenicity and carcinogenicity studies are not generally
required for evaluation of a Similar Biologic unless warranted by the
results from the repeated-dose toxicological studies*. *

Based on the successful evaluation of preclinical study reports
including demonstration of consistency of the process and product,
product characterization, product specifications and comparison of
similar biologics to reference Biologic, RCGM will recommend the DCG(I)
to allow the sponsor to conduct appropriate phase of clinical trial as
per the CDSCO requirements. The applicant may submit parallel
application to RCGM and office of DCG (I) seeking approval to conduct
clinical trial. However, office of DCG (I) shall complete the scrutiny
of application and issue permission, only after RCGM recommendation was
received.”

The key challenges faced by Indian Industries with respect to the
current regulatory process are:

1.  Sacrifice of animals in toxicology studies with no additional
    insight into biosimilarity is against the International Council of
    Harmonization (ICH) guidelines to promote safe, ethical development
    and availability of new drugs with reduced use of animals in
    accordance with the 3R (reduce/refine/replace) principles

2.  India often are not a part of global trials due to this requirement.
    All other Agencies do not require the in-vivo non-clinical studies
    including toxicity studies and ultimately the global trials are done
    excluding India as one of the sites. 

3.  Many times, when the pharmacologically relevant model is not
    available companies end up performing the toxicity studies in a
    non-relevant animal model for the sake of meeting the regulatory
    expectation in India

4.  There is also requirement of conducting the animal immunogenicity
    studies. Since most of the Biosimilars are humanized proteins, they
    elicit immune response in animals which cannot be extrapolated to
    the human immune response and therefore this data becomes irrelevant
    from the product development perspective. 

Based on the above, no additional information is gained from the in-vivo
non-clinical studies, while excessive investment of time and money spent
on such toxicity studies resulting in delayed access of affordable
biosimilar products to the Indian patients.

Recommendation: 

Waive the in-vivo non-clinical studies for Similar Biologics /
Biosimilar

The proposal is to consider the waiver requirements of in-vivo
non-clinical studies from product development as well as for securing
marketing authorization for biosimilar/similar biologic in India. 

Proposed write-up for Non-clinical studies

2.Non-clinical Studies 

This section provides general guidance on non-clinical information
required for similar biologics. 

- Pharmacodynamic Studies 

i\. *In vitro* studies: Comparability of Similar Biologic and Reference
Biologic shall be established by in vitro cell based bioassay (e.g. cell
proliferation assays /cytotoxicity / neutralizing) and receptor binding
assays. 

ii\. *In vivo* studies: *In vivo* evaluation of Biological/
pharmacodynamic activity may be dispensable if in vitro assays are
available, which are known to reliably reflect the clinically relevant
pharmacodynamic activity of the Reference Biologic. In cases where the
in-vitro assays do not reflect the pharmacodynamics, In vivo studies may
be performed, as applicable.

**Toxicological Studies **

<u>Toxicity waiver for a similar biologic product may be granted by the
agency if the following conditions / criteria are met:</u>

1.  Candidate similar biologic is expressed in an established expression
    system. 

2.  The amino acid sequence of the similar biologics is identical to
    that of the RBP

3.  The strength, route of administration, human dose, indications
    proposed for the similar biologics are same as the RBP 

4.  Process related impurities such as HCP and HCD are within the safety
    limits set by any international agencies

5.  Initial analytical similarity has been demonstrated by structural
    and functional studies 

6.  If there are any identified differences between Similar Biologics
    and Reference biologic, they are scientifically justified to have no
    safety impact

In case, the proposed dosage form and formulation of the similar
biologic is different from the RBP, the applicant need to provide the
rationale for this difference. 

<u>Toxicity waiver for a similar biologic product may not be granted by
the Agency in any of the following scenario:</u>

1.  If there are differences that cannot be ruled out as having no
    safety impact

2.  When a novel excipient is being used for the first time for
    biological products specific to the claim route of administration 

3.  If the applicant plans to do clinical study using a route of
    administration which is not tested / approved by agencies for the
    RBP

4.  If the planned human dose of the drug is higher than approved for
    innovator

If the outcome of the initial analytical similarity exercise suggests
that a Similar biologic candidate may not be highly similar to the RBP,
conduct of toxicity studies in animals does not contribute to resolving
the difference in analytical similarity. Therefore, toxicity studies
should not be done with this intent.

Other toxicological studies, including safety pharmacology, reproductive
toxicology, mutagenicity and carcinogenicity studies, are not generally
required for a Similar Biologic submission.

The justification and the scientific rationale for the waiver of in-vivo
non-clinical studies as well as the advantages of the proposed approach
are provided below: 

Justification for the proposed recommendation:

1.  Science based  

Do the current Toxicology studies for Similar Biologics / Biosimilars
serve any purpose? Are the toxicology study data critical? 

1.  An Innovator product for which a Biosimilar is being developed has
    already been assessed thoroughly through pharmacology and toxicology
    studies in the originator non-clinical and clinical trials and the
    dose selected is generally proven to be having a high benefit to
    risk ratio. Additional in-vivo non-clinical studies for a Biosimilar
    that has already been established to have a very high degree of
    analytical similarity to such an innovator product do not add any
    new knowledge.

2.  Analytical similarity exercise is more sensitive with the current
    state of art analytical tests as compared to in vivo animal studies.

3.  Further, Non-clinical studies conducted for Biosimilars (mostly
    mAbs) in non-relevant species (Rodent or non-rodent) don’t serve any
    purpose since the target (receptor) is not available, leading to no
    drug-target binding. 

4.  New biosimilar mAbs are humanized or fully human and they tend to
    get quickly neutralized in non-relevant species adding no further
    beneficial outcome. 

5.  National Center for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of
    Animals in Research (NC3Rs)-UK, MHRA-UK & Biotech industry conducted
    a study on the use of animals in Biosimilar drug development (3). As
    per the study, 

“The working group also was not able to identify an instance where
nonclinical *in-vivo* data provided useful information to a proposed
biosimilar program that had a strong *in-vitro* data package showing a
high degree of similarity. It is the opinion of the working group that
nonclinical *in-vivo* studies do not add value in assessing the
similarity of proposed biosimilars in most cases, primarily because of
the variability and general insensitivity of *in-vivo* studies relative
to *in-vitro* assays.”

“In our opinion, the majority of decisions on similarity should be based
on *in-vitro* studies of quality attributes, and a lack of similarity or
inadequate *in-vitro* data should not justify the conduct of *in-vivo*
studies.”

FDA: Scientific Considerations in Demonstrating Biosimilarity to a
Reference Product, April 2015 (4)

*Animal Toxicity Studies*

*<u>As a scientific matter, animal toxicity data are considered useful
when, based on the results of extensive structural and functional
characterization, uncertainties remain about the safety of the proposed
product that need to be addressed before initiation of clinical studies
in humans</u> (assuming results from animal studies can meaningfully
address the remaining uncertainties).*

*The scope and extent of any animal toxicity studies will depend on
information about the reference product, information about the proposed
product, and the extent of known similarities or differences between the
two. <u>FDA encourages sponsors to initiate early discussions with the
Agency with regard to their biosimilar development plans, including
identifying appropriate scientific justifications for not conducting an
animal toxicity study or for the scope and extent of such a
study.” </u>*

*“Animal toxicity studies are generally not useful if there is no animal
species that can provide pharmacologically relevant data for the product
(i.e., no species in which the biologic activity of the product mimics
the human response).”*

- <u>US House passes legislation to end FDA animal testing Mandate
  (Express Pharma News June 2022) (5)</u>

 The US House of Representatives has passed the FDA Modernization Act as
a rider to a larger package of FDA-related reforms. *“Leaders of the
House and lawmakers from both parties, recognise that the United States
must lift archaic animal-testing mandate for drug development and
replace that strategy with 21st-century methods grounded on human
biology,”* said Wayne Pacelle, President, Animal Wellness Action. *“This
is the biggest policy development in Congressional history on the fight
to replace animal testing with morally and scientifically superior
methods.”*

<https://www.expresspharma.in/us-house-passes-legislation-to-end-fda-animal-testing-mandate/>

- U.S. Senator Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) introduced The Reducing Animal
  Testing (RAT) Act to remove the requirement for animal studies in the
  approval specific biosimilar drug applications (6)

- Robust scientific evidence states that animal models do not provide
  necessary information in the determination of safety and effectiveness
  for biosimilar drugs. The legislation would remove this requirement
  and save needless animal testing while maintaining the FDA’s ability
  to fully assess the safety and effectiveness of biosimilar drugs.

Biosimilars are generic versions of biologic drugs. The Biologics Price
Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCI Act) was passed as part of
the Affordable Care Act that President Obama signed into law on March
23, 2010. The law created an abbreviated licensure pathway for
biosimilar products and requires the applicant submit three things to
prove 1) analytical studies, 2) clinical studies, and 3) animal models.
Scientific research has found that the first two are sufficient, and
animal models are not necessary in this application process (6).

1.  Risk based 

If the toxicology studies for Similar Biologics / Biosimilars waived off
– is there any increase in risk or perception of risk and what is the
mitigation strategy

There is no increase in risk or perception of risk if the toxicology
studies for Similar Biologics / Biosimilars are waived. Also, no
bridging studies are required. Justification for the same is provided
below:

1.  Analytical Similarity is one of the key strategies in establishing
    the physiochemical and functional properties with Reference product
    followed by clinical trial and can be used as mitigation strategy
    for the waiver of in-vivo non-clinical studies. If any differences
    detected in the quality attributes are appropriately justified with
    regard to their potential impact on safety (including
    immunogenicity) and efficacy then Analytical Similarity package is
    robust by orthogonal analytical methods to any difference
    characterize properties such as primary, secondary, tertiary  &
    biological activities (by In-vitro)  & other properties as
    appropriate, no further *in-vivo* toxicological studies or bridging
    toxicology/non-clinical study are required as tests of analytical
    similarity are more sensitive to identify differences than the
    animal studies. In general, Analytical similarity and Clinical
    study/ies are sufficient to prove the safety, purity and potency of
    the Biosimilar product not requiring any bridging study. 

<!-- -->

1.  Toxicity studies done in Non-relevant species provide no additional
    insights as these studies do not provide any technical or scientific
    information (due to non-availability of target / receptor) about
    similarity which an Analytical Similarity program can prove.

<!-- -->

1.  Relevant species are also not recommended by global regulatory
    agencies and waivers have already been granted as there is minimal
    insight through these studies unlike Analytical Similarity which
    gives lot of information about the Biosimilar molecule as the tests
    are orthogonal. There is now precedence of Indian companies getting
    the Toxicity waiver for Biosimilar development from global
    regulatory agencies and the table below summarizes the same.

| Agency | Number of advices  | Toxicity waiver granted | Period in which Toxicity waiver was granted | Number of In-house and RMP batches used for seeking Toxicity waiver |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| US-FDA | 8 | Yes | 2016 to 2023 | NMT 3 |
| EMA | 9 | Yes | 2014 to 2023 | NMT 3 |
| MHRA | 2 | Yes | 2021 to 2023 | NMT 3 |

4.  The animal toxicity studies and immunogenicity studies in the
    non-relevant animal species should be discouraged. Moreover, in
    India the toxicity studies are normally conducted on rats and
    rabbits, which in the case of mAbs is considered to be
    inappropriate.

<!-- -->

4.  If a biosimilar candidate may not be highly similar to the RP with
    respect to analytical similarity, conduct of in-vivo studies in
    animals does not contribute to resolving this and in-vivo studies
    should not be done with this intent. As per UK guideline,
    development as a new biological product should be considered.

<!-- -->

4.  A reference biological product that has undergone animal toxicity
    testing has established safety in humans. In case of biosimilars,
    analytical similarity alone is sensitive enough to demonstrate that
    there is no risk of unexpected response (14).

Opinion: The Debate Over Animal Toxicology Studies;
<https://www.centerforbiosimilars.com/view/opinion-the-debate-over-animal-toxicology-studies>

> **7.Non-animal Methodologies (NAMs) for drug testing**

**7.1 Background (Global and Indian - market size and number of
approvals)**

Animal testing has been the backbone of preclinical studies for drug
development. Both rodent and non-rodent models are used  to assess 
systemic as well as tissue specific toxicity, efficacy and
pharmacokinetics of a particular drug (PMID: 33442468). For example
dermal toxicity assessments of a drug involves invivo tests in rabbits
like the Draize skin irritation assay<sup>1</sup>. 

However, these models often fail to recapitulate the complexity of human
biological systems specifically in the context of organ-specific
toxicity and disease-specific responses <sup>2</sup>. The translational
success rate from animals to humans is low. A study conducted by Daniel
G Hackam et al in 2006 revealed that out of the 76 animal studies only
28 were replicated in human trials, which indicated that about one third
of animal research translated at the level of human  trials (PMID:
17032985). Only 10% of the drug development projects make it from phase
1 to approval (PMID: 27357012, PMID: 21283095, PMID: 39805539). This
results in delay in the delivery of safe and effective therapies to
patients. Despite the use of animal models for evaluating drug safety
and efficacy, it has become increasingly evident that these methods
cannot accurately predict human responses <sup>3</sup>. There is a
species-specific differences in physiology, metabolism and genetics 
between animals and human which leads to discrepancies in data (PMID:
23401516). The poor transcriptional response of mouse model to human
diseases is due to the evolutional distance between mice and humans, the
complexity of the human disease, the inbred nature of the mouse model,
the use of single mechanistic models, the differences in cellular
composition between mouse and human tissues (PMID: 23401516). This
results in failure of clinical trials <sup>4</sup>, <sup>5</sup> . These
challenges emphasize on  the urgent need for innovative and
human-centric non-animal testing platforms.

Because of this, over the last few decades, a number of global
regulatory developments have been done to promote non-animal
methodologies. The main attention has been given to the 3R principles
(replacement, reduction, refinement of animal use) with more focus on
tests that reduces the use of animals .This has been mandated by the
Directive 2010/63/EU and seen in the recent EU resolution ([TA
MEF](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2021-0387_EN.pdf))
and actions<sup>6</sup>, <sup>7</sup>.

The adoption of Non-Animal Methods or New Approach Methodologies (NAMs)
is revolutionizing the field of drug discovery and toxicity assessment
by offering more human-relevant, ethical and scientifically advanced
alternatives to traditional animal testing <sup>8</sup>.NAMs leverage
technologies such as 2D invitro cultures, 3D organoids,3D organ-on-chips
and computational modelling to address the limitations of animal
testing. NAMs can reduce animal testing in the non-clinical domain. For
example, in September, 2024, FDA’s CDER accepted Emulate Bio’s liver on
chip into their ISTAND (Innovative Science and Technology Approaches for
New Drugs  pilot program). The ISTAND Pilot Program accepts submissions
for qualification of types of drug development tools (DDTs) that are out
of scope for existing DDT qualification programs but may still be
beneficial for drug development. This liver on chip can be used to
predict DILI for different therapeutic drugs.(PMID: 39155655). 

The global NAMs testing market size has grown rapidly in recent years. A
report from the business research company published in January 2025
estimated that the NAMs market will grow from \$ 2.33 billion in 2024 to
\$ 2.6 billion in 2025. This growth is due to: i)  economic growth in
the drug market ii) increasing cost of animal studies iii) increased
adoption of such technologies iv) increased investment towards NAMs v)
increased research grants for NAMs vi) increased social awareness
against animal cruelty. 

(<https://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/report/non-animal-alternatives-testing-global-market-report>
<u>)</u>

Many major pharmaceutical players in the field of NAMs are spin off from
academic labs. For example TissUse from Technische University Berlin,
Emulate Bio from Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering in
Boston, Mimetas from Leiden University and Nortis from University of
Washington. Other suppliers licensed MPS technologies from academia. For
example, CN Bio licensing the PhysioMimix platform from the
Massachusetts Institute of technology (MIT) in Cambridge, InSphero
licensing the tissue plate platform from the ETH in Zurich and Hesperos
using the technology developed at Cornell University. This indicates a
collaborative approach between academia and industry (PMID: 32113184)
(table).

This chapter provides insight into the key global industry players in
NAMs .These global industry players collaborate directly with
international regulatory agencies like US FDA to validate new
approaches. This includes standardized protocols and accepted validation
studies. Studying these global industry players is essential because
they can bridge the Indian datasets with global requirements and make
them more streamlined ,scientifically sound and accepted by regulatory
agencies.This chapter also focuses on the NAMs and  their application in
tissue specific toxicity and efficacy studies with main focus on their
strengths, limitations. This study also builds recommendations for
increasing adoption of NAMs by the Indian pharmaceutical industry, CROs
and academicians.

7.2 Methodology (exact regulations cited and stakeholders consulted)

A detailed list of major industry players in NAMs was created after
curating different company websites (attached in supplementary
document 1) which was validated by multiple stakeholders (Table 1).
Recommendations ( specifically in an Indian context) for the adoption
of  NAMs were made after consulting with these stakeholders. The
flowchart for the methodology is given in Fig 1. The methodology
followed is listed:

7.2.1. Analysing company websites, application notes and publications

Detailed information from manufacturers like AxoSim, Tissuse, Emulate
Bio, inSphero, EPISKIN, etc about their products/ technologies were
analysed. This includes information on tissue-specific applications, the
disease model studied, the end-points evaluated, etc. Documents
containing information on how NAMs are applied in real-world scenarios
including methodologies, protocols and outcomes for specific use cases
like drug efficacy, absorption, and metabolism studies were collected
and reviewed. These documents are catalogued in specific folders
(tissue-wise categorization of folders). Publications that serve as
validation reports, detailing experimental outcomes and supporting the
usage of NAM technologies were analysed. Over 124 company websites were 
curated and over 400 publications were reviewed and analysed.

7.2.2. Compiling a list of industry- players in NAMs for tissue-specific
toxicity

NAMs based on their application to specific tissues or organs such as
the liver, heart, skin,eye, kidney, intestine, lungs and nervous system
were listed in Supplementary document 1 (detailed list) and in Tables
2-9. The list included information on whether the model is 2D, 3D, or
*in-silico*, the type of cells or materials used, and the *in vitro*
endpoints measured. The models that meet global regulatory guidelines,
e.g., OECD, FDA, and ICH guidelines were identified ensuring relevance
for preclinical testing and regulatory submissions​​. The names, websites
and contact details of manufacturers, along with any supporting
publications or application notes were included in the list​​.

We have classified these NAMs based on their technology readiness level
(TRL) considering i) their complexity of adoption ii) their overall
impact including cost efficiency, reduction in animal usage iii) status
of their approval by regulatory agencies and iv) their scalability and
usage.

7.2.3. Engaging stakeholders for input

We engaged in discussions with key stakeholders to validate and refine
the list of industry players in NAMs. This was a critical step to ensure
their adoption in the Indian market. The stakeholders were consulted to
validate the list as well as provide recommendations to increase
adoption of NAMs in the Indian market. The following group of
stakeholders were consulted (Table 1 shows the details of the
stakeholders consulted):

1.  Pharmaceutical companies

2.  Contract Research Organizations (CROs)

3.  Academicians and researchers

4.  Toxicologists

7.3. NAMs in toxicity testing and their applications

In this section we have highlighted the key industry players in NAMs
for  tissue specific toxicity studies. Accordingly, the applications of
NAMs has been divided into type of toxicity testing including Dermal,
hepatic, renal, respiratory, CNS, cardiac, intestinal  and ocular The
usage of NAMs in these areas are more relevant to humans and can also
lead to a potential reduction in the number of animals being used for
preclinical studies. The detailed list of the industry players is
provided in Supplementary document 1.

7.3.1. Dermal toxicity testing

The use of animal testing like the Draize skin test for testing of skin
irritation has limitations like a large variation in test results and
species-difference between rabbit and human (PMID:
[28744350](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28744350/)). Alternatives to
animal testing of dermal toxicity are designed to measure a range of
biological endpoints which are critical to understand the effects of
chemicals and drugs on human skin. These include evaluating skin
irritation, corrosion and sensitization. These endpoints can be
validated by measuring cell viability, histopathology and cytokine
release. International regulatory agencies have established
comprehensive guidelines to ensure the reliability and validity of
non-animal testing methods.OECD guidelines like OECD TG 431 and TG 439
permit the use of NAMs for chemical testing for invitro skin corrosion,
sensitization and irritation. OECD has validated five skin models :
SkinEthic RHE, Episkin, EpiDerm<sup>TM</sup>, EPI-MODEl-24, and
epiCS®<sup>9</sup>,<sup>10</sup>. 

A study by Fusco et al states that OECD TG 439 validated SkinEthic™
Reconstructed human Epidermis (RhE) can also be used for graphene-based
materials (GBM). SkinEthic™ was used in this study to predict the skin
irritation potential of GBMs using MTT assay and measuring cytokine
release like IL-6, IL-8, IL-1α <sup>11</sup>. In a study by Kojima et al
in 2012, 25 chemicals were tested for their dermal toxicity using
LabCyte EPI-MODEL24. MTT assay and IL-1α measurements were done using
the model and the data generated was accurate and highly reproducible
between different laboratories<sup>12</sup>. Similarly, the skin
irritation test (SIT) method for epiCS® was done for substances to
distinguish them as irritants and non-irritants by exposing the tissues
to the substance for 20 mins followed by a MTT assay. The validation of
the SIT method was done by EURL-ECVAM and was incorporated into OECD TG
439 <sup>13</sup>.Since the RhE closely mimics the histological,
morphological, biochemical and physiological properties of the upper
parts of the human skin, i.e. the epidermis,these invitro models can
provide to be an alternative to animal testing while ensuring high
compliance with global regulatory standards,  They are important for the
development of safer cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. RhE models can be 

used for measuring in vitro drug release (IVRT) and in vitro drug
permeation testing (IVPT) in pharma industries (PMID:
[35893811](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35893811/)). In order to
ensure adoption of these NAMs in the Indian pharmaceutical context,
there should be collaborative work among academia, industry, and
regulatory agencies in the pharmaceutical community (PMID: 37702017).
Also, establishment of biobanks which can provide a source of
keratinocytes and  primary dermal cells can also act as the driving
force to facilitate the adoption of these NAMs.

7.3.2. Hepatic toxicity testing

The animal models to study hepatic toxicity, for example, idiosyncratic
DILI is difficult to reproduce in human.There are species specific
differences in metabolism between mice, rats, monkeys, dogs and humans.
For example, animals express homologs of cytochrome P450 in humans. All
the homologs do not have the same substrate specificity, while mice show
more resemblance in P450 activity to humans, rats show least resemblance
(PMID: 31007174). This leads to preclinical failure of drugs This
creates a challenge in using animal models for predicting liver toxicity
in humans accurately. Therefore, application of NAMs in hepatic toxicity
testing holds a great potential for the pharma industry in the drug
development field. We have identified 20 global industry players in the
context of hepatic NAMs. The invivo endpoints for liver toxicity are
DILI assessment by  measuring blood biomarkers (ALT, AST, etc.),
histopathology, and clinical/behavioral observations. The invitro
endpoints for liver toxicity are assessment of DILI by measuring the
cell viability, leakage of hepatic enzymes like cytochrome P450,
measuring the Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) activity, Aspartate
Aminotransferase (AST) activity and oxidative stress markers (PMID:
32325112).These invitro endpoints mimics the existing invivo endpoints
and can predict hepatic toxicity

Few examples are provided in Table 3 (A detailed list is provided in
Supplementary document 1). Regulatory guidelines play a crucial role in
ensuring the reliability of liver toxicity studies using NAMs. The key
guidelines include the FDA Guidance on In Vitro Methods<sup>16.</sup>.

One of the companies that works in the field of liver NAMs is Emulate
Bio. In September, 2024, FDA’s CDER accepted Emulate Bio’s liver on chip
into their ISTAND pilot program. This liver on chip can be used to
predict DILI for different therapeutic drugs. Ewing et al in 2024 has
demonstrated the toxicology and pharmacology of cannabidol (CBD) for the
first time using these liver-on-chip systems.By measuring the levels of
ALT, miR-122 and Cyt P450 enzymes using these microphysiological
systems, they showed the potential of these systems to translate data
into clinical studies <sup>20</sup>.InSphero, another company working in
the field of liver NAMs have developed liver microtissues can be used
for DILI prediction. In 2021, InSphero launched a consortium in
collaboration with key pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer, Sanofi,
Merck and Genentech for drug testing to predict DILI. A study by
Kostadinova et al in 2024 stated the use of these microtissues can also
be used to test the efficacy of antifibrotic compounds <sup>18</sup>.
InSphero in collaboration with FDA NCTR published a study in 2024 where
they tested 152 FDA approved drugs for hepatotoxicity using these
microtissues<sup>19</sup>. These studies indicate that these advanced
technologies provide robust tools for evaluating liver toxicity ensuring
safer pharmaceuticals and reducing reliance on animal studies. To
accelerate the adoption of these techniques by Indian pharmaceutical
companies, there is a need to develop scientifically validated sources
of cell lines like hepatocytes and primary cells (PMID: 23495363).
Therefore, the establishment of indigenous biobank is necessary.

7.3.3. Renal toxicity testing

Kidney plays an important role in filtration, reabsorption and
excretion. This makes them highly susceptible to the toxic effects of
drugs. About 19-33% of acute kidney injury cases are due to drug
nephrotoxicity (PMID:
[30649541](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30649541/)). Therefore, renal
toxicity testing becomes an essential component of drug safety
evaluation.The invivo endpoints to detect renal toxicity for drugs
includes urinary volume, specific gravity, osmolality, pH,
fluid/electrolyte balance, proteins, cytology, evaluation of biomarkers
of nephrotoxicity and blood chemistry determinations such as blood urea
nitrogen, creatinine and plasma proteins (ICH S7A guidelines). These
animal studies are expensive, have low-throughput and are time-consuming
and lower human reproducibility (PMID: 20574894). Therefore, animal
studies to predict renal toxicity leads to 8% to 9% drug failure in
preclinical and clinical stages of drug development (PMID:
[30649541](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30649541/), PMID: 24833294).
The use of NAMs for this purpose can provide  human-relevant
alternatives that enhance the accuracy of prediction and also align with
the principles of the 3Rs. Evaluation of kidney toxicity using NAMs
includes a wide array of endpoints which include biomarkers of renal
toxicity including urinary total protein, kidney injury molecule-1
(KIM-1), clusterin, β2-microglobulin (β2-MG), cystatin C (CysC), trefoil
factor-3 (TFF-3), renal papillary antigen-1 (RPA-1) and albumin. The
measurement of cell viability, LDH, GSH and ATP can also be used for
studying renal toxicity (PMID:
[30510689](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30510689/)). We have 
identified 8 industry players in the context of kidney NAMs. A few of
them have been listed in Table 4. 

The regulatory guidelines like ICH S7A outline the requirements for
safety evaluation emphasizing the kidney toxicity endpoints in
preclinical studies and support the usage of NAMs where
validated<sup>22</sup>.

A few key industry players in kidney NAMs that are listed in Table 4
are: EpiKidney™ (MatTek Lifesciences), Kidney-on-Chip (Emulate Bio) and
HUMIMIC® Kidney (Tissuse). A study by Kaluzhny et al showed that
Epikindney from MatTek Lifesciences can mimic human kidney. It expresses
the markers for renal clearance, secretion, and reabsorption. Therefore,
it can be used to predict human nephrotoxicity<sup>23</sup> . Another
study from Mou et al, 2024 showed that they have successfully built a
kidney glomerulus-on-chip that mimics glomerular morphology and barrier
function using  biomimetic ultrathin membrane and human-induced
pluripotent stem cells from Emulate Bio.  This chip can be used for
modelling human kidney specific morphogenesis and function
<sup>24</sup>. Somova et al in 2024 developed a renal cell carcinoma
model using TissUse Humimic platform which can mimic the interplay
between healthy and malignant human tissue. They co-cultured healthy
human renal proximal tubule epithelial cells and renal cell carcinoma
spheroids. This co-culture system enabled them to study host-tumor
interactions <sup>25</sup>.

These studies reveal that NAM technologies can be used for drug-induced
nephrotoxicity screening and studying the PKPD of the drug. Currently, a
major factor which limits the adoption of invitro methods for renal
toxicity is the lack of valid in vitro cell models of the kidney.
Secondly there is a lack of robust markers of kidney toxicity studies
by  in vitro methods (PMID:
[29626199](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29626199/)). A well
established indigenous biobank which can provide validated cell lines
can accelerate the development of adoption of NAMs by Indian
pharmaceutical companies.

7.3.4. Respiratory toxicity testing

Respiratory toxicity testing is essential for evaluating the safety of
drugs, chemicals, and environmental pollutants that may impact lung
function. The invivo end points used to detect lung toxicity are
respiratory rate and respiratory function (e.g., tidal volume or
hemoglobin oxygen saturation).These include evaluations of both the
total respiratory system and the mechanical properties of the lung (ICH
S7A guidelines). But animal models fail to accurately predict lung
toxicity of drugs. Animal models differ from humans in the deposition
pattern of drugs and also in pathways by which the drug is cleared from
the lungs. This species specific difference results in drug failure
during the drug development process (PMID: 32582672). The use of NAMs
can provide an accurate alternative to animal testing. These invitro 
techniques  mimic in vivo lung structure & function and are of human
origin. In vitro air-liquid interface (ALI) cell culture models can
potentially be used to assess inhalation toxicology endpoints like
percentage cytotoxicity and release of cytokines (IL-6, IL-8)/chemokines
(MCP-1/CCL2, CXCL1/Groα, CXCL2/Groβ) and trans-epithelial electrical
resistance (TEER) (PMID: 32325112). We identified 16 global industry
players in the context of respiratory NAMs. A few of them have been
listed in Table 5 (The detailed list is provided in Supplementary
document 1). 

The use of NAMs in respiratory toxicity testing is increasingly
supported by regulatory guideline ICH S7A  which emphasizes the
importance of safety evaluations that consider respiratory system
toxicity during non-clinical studies<sup>22</sup>.

A few industry players in NAMs for respiratory toxicity listed in Table
5 include: Lung-on-Chip (AlveoliX), MucilAir™ (Epithelix), EpiAirway™
(MatTek Lifesciences), Lung-on-chip (Emulate Bio), HUMIMIC® Lung
(Tissuse) and ALIsens (Invitrolize). 

AlveoliX is one of the key industry player in respiratory NAMs.
AlveoliX’s Lung-on-Chip has been widely used by academicians and CROs
for testing inhalation toxicity. Sengupta et al in 2022 for the first
time reported a  primary derived alveolar epithelial cell line on-chip 
which represented both Alveolar Type 1 and 2  characteristics. This
AXlung-on-chip from AlveoliX can be used for  inhalation toxicity of
drugs and xenobiotics characterization<sup>27</sup>. Another study
conducted by Cochin et al in 2021 used MucilAir™ from Epithelix to show
that hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin cannot be used as antiviral
drugs against SARS-CoV-2 viral infections. This data was replicable in
hamster model for the infection. This indicated that MucilAir™ can be
used as a reliable model system to mimic human lung and can be used to
study respiratory disease pathologies<sup>28</sup>. Burla et al in 2024
showed that ALIsens<sup>® </sup> from Invitrolize (3D alveolar model)
can identify respiratory toxic compounds. In this study they have also
identified   thymic stromal lymphopoietin receptor (TSLPr) cell surface
marker as a biomarker for predicting respiratory hazards<sup>29</sup>.
Wallace et al in 2023 has used human and rat EpiAirway™ for studying the
inhalation toxicity of therapeutic drugs. The end points for toxicity
measurements were viability by MTT assay, epithelial barrier integrity
(TEER, transepithelial electrical resistance) and tissue morphology.
Their study led to the conclusion that both rat and human EpiAirway™
respond similarly to drugs<sup>30</sup>. Lung-on-chip from Emulate Bio
has also been used extensively. A study conducted by Si et al in 2021
utilized the lung-on-chip from Emulate Bio to identify antiviral
therapeutics and prophylactics <sup>31</sup>. These various studies
indicate that NAMs have a potential for screening drugs for inhalation
toxicity. In order to facilitate adoption of these invitro methods for
inhalation toxicity prediction, The cell culture should be done in ALI
conditions, i.e., cultures where cells are grown in direct contact with
air (PMID: 32582672). Also there should be an indigenous source of
validated primary cells obtained from human donors to catalyze the
adoption of NAMs by Indian pharmaceutical companies.

7.3.5. Central Nervous System (CNS) toxicity testing

CNS toxicity testing is a critical component in evaluating the safety of
pharmaceutical compounds particularly those that cross or interact with
the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The invivo endpoints used to detect
neurotoxicity of compounds include evaluation of motor activity,
behavioral changes, coordination, sensory/motor reflex responses and
body temperature (ICHS7A guidelines). But these animal models do not
accurately predict human disease. Specific differences in blood-brain
barrier (BBB) permeability, drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters
can lead to differences in drug exposure in the human brain compared to
animals (PMID: [29464550](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29464550/)).
NAMs can be used for replicating CNS-specific toxicity thereby providing
alternatives to traditional in vivo methods. The invitro end points
include measurement of neurodevelopmental process at cellular level
(e.g.,proliferation, migration, neurite growth, synaptogenesis,
myelination, apoptosis) and nervous system connectivity (e.g.
structural, neurochemical, neurophysiological).The key guidelines
include ICH S7A<sup>22</sup> and OECD TG 426 which provides guidelines
for Developmental Neurotoxicity (DNT) invitro battery
testing<sup>36</sup>. 

In our study 18 global industry players in NAMs were identified in the
context of CNS. A few of them are listed in Table 6 (The detailed list
is provided in Supplementary document 1). 

A few key industry players in NAMs listed in table 6 include BrainSim,
NerveSim, microBrain (AxoSim), Brain-on-chip (Emulate Bio), Neural
spheroids (BrainXell), 2D- invitro iPSC culture (Neurosetta), 3D-
Compartmentalized GABAergic & Glutamatergic Neurons (NETRI) and
MEPS-BBB-on-Chip. In 2021. Pediaditakis et al developed a Parkinsoon’s
disease model using Emulate Bio’s human brain-on-chip. This model could
mimic all the characteristics of Parkinson’s disease including the
accumulation of phospho α-Syn protein<sup>37</sup>. A number of studies
have been conducted globally using AxoSim’s 3D technologies. For example
in a study conducted by Zhong et al in 2020, they used the brain
spheroids to detect the developmental neurotoxicity of Paroxetine which
is a Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor <sup>38</sup>. In another
study by Gabriel-Segard et al in 2023, used 2D- invitro iPSC culture
from Neurosetta to build a microfluidic technology to model bilateral
neuro-immunological communication. This model can be used to test drug
compounds along the gut-brain axis<sup>39</sup>. Another commercial
player is NETRI which produces 3D- Compartmentalized GABAergic &
Glutamatergic Neurons which can be used for detecting developmental
neurotoxicity and drug screening. In 2020, Fantuzzoa et al in his study
showed that these neurons can be used for drug screening
applications<sup>40</sup>.

Such different studies indicate that these NAMs can be used for studying
developmental neurotoxicity and functional neuronal evaluations.

7.3.6. Cardiotoxicity testing

Cardiotoxicity of drugs remains a serious concern in drug development
and chemical safety evaluation as adverse effects on the heart can lead
to severe health outcomes including arrhythmias, myocardial dysfunction
and heart failure(PMID:
[29315692](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29315692/)). A  large number
of invivo tests are routinely   performed to evaluate 
cardiotoxicity.The invivo endpoints include measurement of blood
pressure, heart rate, ECG and follow up parameters include cardiac
output, ventricular contractility and vascular resistance (ICHS7A,
ICHS7B guidelines). But species differences lead to increasing chance of
false positive or false negative prediction of patient responses (PMID:
[31600125](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31600125/)). Therefore, NAMs
can be used as an alternative to animal testing offering human-relevant
insights into cardiac function, electrophysiology and cellular
mechanisms of toxicity. The invitro endpoints include measurement of 
pro-arrythmia risk by delayed ventricular potential. This can be
measured by measuring the  ionic currents in cardiomyocytes, action
potential parameters in isolated cardiac preparations  and QT interval.
Invitro IKr assays, ventricular repolarization assays and invitro
electrophysiology studies like cardiomyocyte calcium handling
transients, contractility, calcium homeostasis are also measured as
invitro parameters for testing of cardiotoxicity (ICHS7B guidelines).  
                                                                       
                                                                       
                                                                       
                                                                       
                                                                       
                                                                       
                      The use of NAMs in cardiotoxicity testing is
increasingly supported by key guidelines which include ICH S7A and S7B
which focus on evaluating the potential for delayed ventricular
repolarization (QT interval prolongation) and associated risks of
arrhythmias. It supports the use of in vitro and in silico models for
early hazard identification<sup>22</sup>,<sup>43</sup>. An  initiative
to accelerate use of invitro methods for cardiotoxicity prediction is
the FDA Comprehensive In Vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CiPA) which
recommends combining ion channel assays, hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes,
and in silico models to predict proarrhythmic risk, enhancing the
reliability of non-animal testing approaches<sup>44</sup>.

 (<https://www.fda.gov/drugs/regulatory-science-action/impact-story-improved-assessment-cardiotoxic-risk-drug-candidates-comprehensive-in-vitro-proarrhythmia><u>). </u>

We identified 12 key industry players for  cardiac NAMs. A few of them
have been listed in Table 7 (Detailed list provided in Supplementary
document 1). The industry-players in cardiac NAMs listed in Table 7 are
3D Cardiac Organoids by 4D Cell, Heart-on-Chip systems (BiomimX), Ncyte®
vCardiomyocytes, Ncyte® aCardiomyocytes (NCardia) , Atrial
cardiomyocytes, Ventricular cardiomyocytes (Axol Biosciences),
TrueCardium® Cardiac Organoids (inSphero) and The Maestro Pro and Edge
MEA systems (Axion Biosystems). In 2024, Axion Biosystems launched the
new [Maestro
Volt](https://www.axionbiosystems.com/products/mea/maestro-volt)™ which 
serves as an affordable benchtop microelectrode array (MEA) system . It
can therefore meet the demands of academic labs with limited budgets. 
In the field of cardiac NAMs, Axol Biosciences have also made a
significant progress. In a study conducted in 2021 by Kanade at al, they
used cardiomyocytes from Axol biosciences to determine the effect of
hypothermia on mechano physiology and electrophysiology of heart
<sup>45</sup>. In 2020, Błyszczuk et al conducted a study using
inSPhero’s 3D cardiac microtissues to model cardiac
fibrosis<sup>46</sup>. Another global player,Ncardia in January 2025
announced the launch of  *Ncyte<sup>®</sup> Heart in a Box*  which is a
robust platform to study heart disease and heart development. 

These studies implies that NAMs can be applied in the context of
drug-induced cardiotoxicity screening, investigating cellular and
molecular pathways involved in cardiotoxicity.

7.3.7. Intestinal toxicity  testing

The intestinal tract plays a critical role in nutrient absorption,
metabolism and barrier defence making it highly susceptible to toxicity
from pharmaceuticals, chemicals and environmental agents. Animal models
are used to study intestinal toxicity endpoints like gastric secretion,
gastrointestinal injury potential, bile secretion, transit time in vivo,
ileal contraction in vitro, gastric pH measurement (ICHS7A guidelines).
The invivo testing methods are costly and not translationally relevant
due to species differences leading to failure of clinical trials. NAMs
can provide an alternative invitro platform to test drugs for intestinal
toxicity. The endpoints NAMs can be used to study are permeability,
barrier function, drug absorption, metabolism and drug transport.  We
identified 8 key industry players for intestinal NAMs. A few of them are
listed in Table 8 (The entire list is provided in Supplementary document
1). Global regulatory guidelines that support the integration of NAMs in
intestinal toxicity studies are ICH S7A which emphasizes the importance
of safety evaluations that consider intestinal toxicity during
non-clinical studies<sup>22</sup>. Some of the key industry-players in
intestinal NAMs listed in table 8 include Colon-on-a-plate® (Prodigest),
RepliGut Systems (Altis Biosystems), EpiIntestinal™ (MatTek Life
Sciences) and Colon-on-chip, Duodenum-on-Chip (Emulate Bio). The
RepliGut systems from Altis Biosystems has been used extensively for
studying drug metabolism, e.g., in 2019, study conducted by Speer at al
used this technology to study the pharmacokinetics of drugs
<sup>51</sup>. Ozkan et al, 2024 used colon-on-chip from Emulate Bio to
study the drivers of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) where they studied
the effect of carcinogens on colon cancer progression and effect of
female hormones on IBD syndrome<sup>52</sup>. Another study by Simon et
al , 2019 studied the effect of interleukin-6 on the drug metabolizing
enzymes and ABC transporters using EpiIntestinal™- 3D from MatTek
Lifesciences <sup>53</sup>.These studies proved that these alternative
technologies can be applied for drug-induced toxicity screening,
pharmacokinetics of drug, food and nutrient safety testing and gut
microbiome interactions.

intestinal toxicity

7.3.8. Ocular toxicity testing

Evaluating the safety of drugs and chemicals on eye is essential as
these may come into direct or indirect contact with our eyes. Animals
tests are used for testing ocular toxicity. For example, Draize test is
used to study ocular toxicity. The invivo models are used to measure
endpoints like ocular corrosion, irritation, sensitivity, absorption and
phototoxicity. Parameters used to measure ocular corrosion and
irritation are tests that evaluates the degree of eye irritation or
corrosion by scoring lesions on the cornea, iris, and conjunctiva. The
animal models perform poorly to translate to human studies. For example,
Draize test is not reliable because of the fundamental anatomical
differences between the human and rabbit eye. This highlights the
disadvantages of  *in vivo* test over *in vitro* alternative. (Stephen
R. Kaufman, M.D.). Thus, we should encourage the usage of vitro
technologies as an alternative to the *in vivo* tests. NAMs can act as
robust tools for ocular safety assessments offering human-relevant
insights into toxicity mechanisms while reducing reliance on animal
testing. The invitro endpoints of ocular corrosion an irritation can be
measured using cell viability assays (MTT assays).These technologies can
be used for evaluating the irritancy potential of pharmaceuticals,
cosmetics and industry chemicals. The regulatory guidelines that promote
alternative methods include OECD TG 496, 498 which specifies the use of
reconstructed human corneal epithelial models, such as EpiOcular™ and
SkinEthic™ HCE for assessing eye irritation and serious eye
damage<sup>55</sup>,<sup>56</sup>.

In our study we have identified 7 global industry player in the field of
ocular NAMs. A few of them have been listed in Table 9 (A detailed list
provided in Supplementary document 1). The few major industry player in
ocular NAMs listed in Table 9 include EpiOcular™ (MatTek Life Sciences),
OptiSafeTM EIT3 (Lebrun labs) SkinEthic™ HCE (Human Corneal Epithelium)
(Episkin). In 2009, Pauly et al, studied the toxic effect of
Benzalkonium Chloride on eye using EpiSkin’s SkinEthicTM HCE - Human
Corneal Epithelium <sup>57</sup>. In another study conducted by Kaluzhny
et al in 2015, tested the effect of solid compounds on eye treated at
different time points from 90 mins to 6 hours<sup>58</sup>. Lubrun labs
in 2019 conducted a study using OptiSafeTM EIT3to develop a prediction
model for classifying irritants on the basis of  in vitro histopathology
studies . They used 16 different chemicals based on Globally Harmonized
System (GHS) and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  (EPA)
classification systems <sup>59</sup>.Therefore, these technologies can
be applied for eye irritancy testing, drug-induced ocular toxicity
testing and permeability and absorption studies.

ocular  toxicity

Based on the analysis of industry- players involved in NAMs, we have
quantified the presence of industry players within the context of
tissue-specific toxicity studies. Of the 124 NAMs evaluated, the highest
number are utilized for studying dermal toxicity (35) and hepatic
toxicity (20). In addition to these, NAMs are also employed for toxicity
assessments of other tissues, including ocular, renal, respiratory,
intestinal, central nervous system (CNS), and cardiac toxicity, as
summarized in Table 10 and illustrated in Figure 2.

7.4. Case studies of NAMs in efficacy assessment and precision medicine

7.4.1. Rare diseases

Rare diseases present an interesting area to use human-relevant
technologies as several challenges are associated with rare disease
therapeutics, with animal models either unavailable or often failing as
preclinical test systems and providing limited insights regarding their
biological mechanisms. Currently, there are no approved treatments for
95% of rare diseases. NAMs are being used in two domains of drug
development for rare diseases: nonclinical research (efficacy testing)
and precision medicine (Table 11).

7.4.2. Cancer

1.  Colorectal cancer

Using a large biobank of patient-derived colorectal cancer organoids
(CRC), MCLA-158, a bispecific antibody binding epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) and leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled
receptor 5 (LGR5), was identified as the most effective antibody as it
could reliably discriminate between cancerous and healthy cells. Based
on the data from human-derived cancer organoids, the compound went from

2.  Small cell lung carcinoma

Amivantamab is a bispecific antibody against EGFR and the
mesenchymal-epithelial transition receptor, and its efficacy was
preclinically tested in patient-derived cells and organoids that
harbour *EGFR* Exon20ins mutation<sup>62</sup>. The standard drugs,
including Tyrosine kinases, have a poor prognosis for this mutation. The
results were replicated in clinical trials (Clinical Trial No.:
[NCT04538664](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04538664)), and
amivantamab was eventually approved by the EMA for the treatment of
non-small cell lung cancer.

3.  Breast Cancer

Currently, 36 trials are underway that are using patient-derived
organoids to verify the effectiveness, feasibility and consistency of
the PDO model in predicting treatment, and establish an evaluation
system for treatment plans to help precision treatment of advanced
breast cancer. Examples of five such trials have been provided for
reference in Table 12.

7.5*. In-silico* approaches to NAMs 

In order to reduce the animals usage in the drug discovery and
development, 3Rs principle was introduced by Russell and Birch in late
1950’s that focussed on replacement, reduction, refinement of animal
use<sup>63</sup>. While the approaches of reduction and refinement have
been practiced widely since last few decades, the concept of replacement
now being increasingly used to promote the complete abolition of all
animal based research <sup>64</sup>. The US FDA modernization act passed
on Oct 2022. This act removed the animal testing as a requirement for
new drug applications (NDA) and is considered as a notable step to
replace animal testing with cutting-edge technologies, cell-based
assays, human organ chips and computational modelling . 

In silico approaches or computational tools in the recent times enabled
the simulation of entire drug discovery and development scenario. These
approaches have demonstrated applications in both preclinical and
clinical development scenarios. In the preclinical space, in silico
approaches are used to predict drug safety, toxicity, efficacy, suitable
formulation selection for toxicity studies and PK-PD correlations. In
clinical development scenarios, in silico approaches are applied to
simulate clinical scenarios such as clinical trial outcome,
bioequivalence and bioavailability predictions, drug-drug interactions
<sup>65</sup>, <sup>66</sup>, optimization of formulation to achieve
desired clinical response. Approaches such as physiologically based
pharmacokinetic modeling (PBPK) and physiologically based
biopharmaceutics modeling (PBBM) enabled clinical development and
transformation by reduction in human clinical studies and trials to a
greater extent <sup>67</sup>, <sup>68</sup>. Regulatory agencies such as
US FDA <sup>69</sup>, and EMA<sup>70</sup> now have dedicated guidance
documents encouraging the sponsors to use these approaches widely at new
drug and generic product development scenarios. 

In the era of preclinical development, the application of in silico
approachesa are multi-fold. In silico simuation approaches can be used
to predict the toxicity resulting from the new chemical entity. For
example, early prediction of cardiotoxicity is essential for drug
development. while the use of animal models raise concerns about ethical
and translational capabilities<sup>71</sup>, human based computational
models were reported. In silico approaches combining computational and
experimental methods<sup>72</sup> can be used to predict clinical risk
of drug induced arrhythmias based on ion channel information. A deep
machine learning approach has been reported in the recent times that
<sup>73</sup> can predict the prolongation of QT interval that can lead
to fatal cardiotoxicity that may result in withdrawal of drugs from the
market, if identified lately. Other models to predict hepatotoxicity
have also been reported in the literature wherein the models built on
complex pathology, hepatotoxicity end points was able to predict
hepatotoxicity early thereby enabling early flagging of molecules
exhibiting such risk patterns<sup>74</sup>. Similarly, computational
models also have been reported in the literature for prediction of
efficacy (e.g. in the field of Cancer)<sup>75</sup> based on molecular,
cellular and clinical data thereby enabling selection of appropriate
molecules for drug development. Such models, when validated against
clinical data, becomes robust and powerful tools to reduce the extent of
preclinical testing in the drug discovery and development program. 

Other potential applications of in silico tools in reduction of animal
testing is the application of quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) in
the drug development. The QSP models are the computational tools that
describe dynamic interactions between drug and pathophysiology to
understand how the system works
(<https://www.allucent.com/resources/blog/benefits-and-uses-qsp-drug-development>).
QSP models are used to predict the exposure in preclinical species, to
perform interspecies scaling, estimating first in human (FIH) exposures
and establishment of in vitro in vivo extrapolation approaches. QSP was
found to have significant role in preclinical stage for oncology
molecules to increase the probability of success of proof of concept
(POC) studies when applied from early preclinical stage<sup>76</sup> .
Such approaches can reduce the use of preclinical studies and animal
requirement for the efficacy studies. Apart from the clinical
pharmacological studies, in silico approaches can be widely used to
support formuation development for preclinical studies, food effect
evaluation, impact of acid reducing agents etc thereby avoiding the
requirement of preclinical studies<sup>77</sup>. 

This summary and assessment clearly indicates the applications of in
silico modeling in reducing the preclinical efficacy, toxicity, ADME
characterization and formulation selections.

7.6. Global regulatory requirements

Global regulatory agencies like FDA, OECD, ICH support the adoption and
usage of NAMs. The FDA regulations under IND (21 CFR 312.23) and NDA (21
CFR 314.50) allow the use of non-animal methods like in-vitro assays for
pharmacology and toxicology data submissions. The FDA and ICH guidelines
(Table 14) encourage the use of alternative methods aligned with the 3Rs
principles<sup>78</sup>. OECD guidelines support invitro methods for
ocular and skin irritation tests (Table 15). Specific ICH guidelines
such as S5(R3) and S10 describe the use of in vitro methods for toxicity
evaluations. These guidelines support the development and regulatory
adoption of NAMs for drug safety evaluations. For an alternative method
to be adopted it must: i)Address specific drug development questions.
ii) Be scientifically validated with reproducible and predictive data.
iii) Define its applicability domain and demonstrate specificity and
sensitivity. The FDA supports integrating NAMs into pharmaceutical
development, provided these methods are scientifically validated for
their intended context. Collaboration between sponsors, the FDA, and
global partners is critical for advancing the regulatory acceptance of
NAMs.The FDA emphasizes flexibility in adopting new methods, ensuring
they meet safety and efficacy standards.

The primary regulatory frameworks in NAMs are driven globally. This
section primarily focuses on the global landscape and industry-players
in NAMs to provide a deeper understanding of evolving technologies.
Understanding the global regulatory trends in NAMs will help the Indian
pharma companies to implement these technologies in compliance with the
international standards.

From the PBPK modeling perspective, regulatory agencies such as EMA and
USFDA have come up with detailed regulatory guidelines. EMA has issued a
guidance on reporting of PBPK modeling and simulation results (effective
in 2019\[SK1\] )<sup>70</sup>, which talks about submitting PBPK models
in regulatory applications. This document aimed to clarify which
supportive data are expected in order to qualify a PBPK platform for
intended application. Recently (Feb 2025), EMA<sup>79</sup> \[SK2\] also
came up with a concept paper on reporting of mechanistic models used in
model informed drug development. The PBBM guidance issued by USFDA in
2\[SK3\] 020<sup>69</sup> focusses on general recommendations regarding
development, evaluation and use of PBPK for biopharmaceutics
applications for both NDA and ANDAs. This guidance applies for orally
administered drug products and talks about evaluating the impact of
various biopharmaceutics attributes on the pharmacokinetic performance
of dosage forms. Most recently, the harmonized guidance (ICH M15\[SK4\]
)<sup>80</sup> has also been issued that details the requirements of
model informed drug development. Overall, the issuance of specific
guidelines from regulatory agencies encourages the use of physiological
models in both new drugs as well as generic product development.

7.7 Current regulatory expectations in India

Clinical trials in India are governed by the Drugs and Cosmetics Act of
1940, the Medical Council of India Act of 1956, the Central Council for
Indian Medicine Act of 1970 and the Guidelines for Exchange of
Biological Material (MOH order, 1997). Researchers seeking to conduct a
clinical trial in the country must obtain permission from the Drugs
Controller General India (DCGI), obtain approval from the Ethics
Committee established under Drugs and Cosmetics Rules and register on
the ICMR-maintained website
(<https://iaspoint.com/india-amends-rules-to-allow-non-animal-drug-testing/>).

The government of India has passed the New Drugs and Clinical Trial
Rules (2023)  whose objective is to replace the use of animals in
research particularly in drug testing. The amendment permits researchers
to use non-animal and human-relevant methods including technologies
like 3D organoids, organs-on-chip, and advanced computational methods
instead of traditional animal methods to test the safety and efficacy of
new drugs. Also, these rules require that any CRO conducting a clinical
trial or bioavailability/bioequivalence study of new drugs or
investigational drugs in human subjects must first obtain registration
from the Central Licensing Authority before proceeding with the study.

(<https://www.biopharmaboardroom.com/news/14/743/india-takes-historic-step-towards-eliminating-animal-testing-in-drug-development.html>)

7.8 Challenges 

Despite the readiness of these NAMs for implementation, several
challenges hinder their adoption in the Indian context:

1.  Scientific Robustness and Validation:

There is a lack of proper cell banks in the country. Therefore, it is
critical to establish biobanks or cell repositories within India.
Multiple stakeholders whom we consulted from different fields like skin,
ocular, liver, lungs, cancer, intestine, brain and cardiac research have
emphasized on the importance of having indigenous quality-controlled
primary cells, cell lines, or immortalized cell lines. Organizations
such as Axol Biosciences (<https://axolbio.com/> ), Cellular Dynamics
(<https://www.fujifilmcdi.com/> ), and ATCC (<https://www.atcc.org/>) 
offer valuable  examples and similar infrastructure must be developed in
India. This will ensure rapid deployment and cost-effective construction
of both 2D and 3D models subject to appropriate intellectual property
considerations.

Robust international guidelines for *in-silico* modeling in drug
toxicity and efficacy studies have facilitated its adoption by companies
globally. Regulatory bodies such as the FDA, have proposed specific
frameworks for using in silico data in drug evaluations<sup>81</sup>.
The Indian scientific community must adopt and adapt these guidelines to
establish credibility and enable seamless integration of in-silico
models into the drug development pipeline.

1.  Economic Considerations:

Although many NAM platforms approved by regulatory guidelines like OECD
are scientifically validated, their adoption within India faces economic
challenges. This includes high costs associated with importing the
technology and potential intellectual property constraints. These
problems highlight the need to develop similar technologies
domestically. This will require strategic planning, identification of
specialized laboratories with the required expertise and targeted
funding. 

7.9. Relevance in India

Though the global scenario for NAMs usage is growing, the Indian
pharmaceutical industry is lagging behind. Therefore, Indian
pharmaceutical industry should catalyze the adoption of NAMs through
prioritizing its usage. The major step towards that will be the
Indigenous establishment of a high quality and well-validated cell
repository for primary cells , cell lines and cells from different
genetic backgrounds. The availability of well validated primary cells is
crucial for drug-screening. Indian users are currently importing the
cell lines from outside which increases the cost of invitro techniques.
Developing an indigenous cell repository will reduce the cost as well as
the time constraint. Also, sourcing the cell culture labwares, media
components and reagents  from outside India is a challenge due to high
cost and logistical challenges which can be overcome by indigenous
production of media components. An effort towards development of an
indigeneous production house which includes production of media
components will enhance India’s research capabilities in drug
development. India lacks the awareness for NAM technologies. Organizing
workshops, training initiatives, knowledge-sharing platforms can help
the Indian pharma industry to incorporate NAMs based technologies in
their drug development pipelines. Building public-private partnerships
can help to bridge  the funding gap for Indian pharma companies and
academia. Grants from Indian government agencies like DBT, CSIR, BIRAC
can help to prioritize NAM development in India. A large population in
India is effected with diseases like cancer, diabetes and respiratory
disorders. Therefore, using NAMs like 3D spheroid cultures or patient
derived iPSC models can be used in efficacy testing of drugs to cure
these complex diseases. 

7.10. Key Recommendations

7.10.1. Opportunities for waiver of toxicology studies

Based on our analysis of the 124 evaluated NAMs, the NAMs related to
liver toxicity have the highest technological readiness level. Notably,
Liver-on-chip from Emulate Bio is part of the FDA’s Innovative Science
and Technology Approaches for New Drugs (ISTAND) Pilot Program and is in
the advanced stage of evaluation and approval. However, no NAMs have
currently received full regulatory acceptance. Therefore at this stage,
no opportunities are identified for waiver of toxicology studies.

7.10.2. Opportunities for reduction of animals in non-clinical studies

Our analysis of the 124 NAMs revealed that the highest number of NAMs
are utilized for studying dermal toxicity (35) and hepatic toxicity
(20). In addition to these, NAMs are also employed for toxicity
assessments of other tissues, including ocular, renal, respiratory,
intestinal, central nervous system (CNS), and cardiac toxicity, as
summarized in Table 10 and illustrated in Figure 2. 

Based on our classification of NAMs, NAMs with high TRL include two
liver NAMs: Liver-on-Chip by Emulate Bio and Liver Spheroids by
InSphero, and five skin NAMs: EPISKIN’s SkinEthic™ RHE, EPISKIN™,
SkinInVitro GmbH’s epiCS®, MatTek Lifesciences’ EpiDerm™, and J-Tec’s
LabCyte EPI-MODEL-24™. 

The five skin NAMs have been validated by OECD Test Guidelines (TG) 431
and 439 for chemicals making them suitable for evaluating skin
irritation, corrosion, and sensitization. They have a high impact and
high complexity of adoption. Though the five skin NAMs are of high TRL
and are validated by OECD guidelines, they are less relevant in the
context of this study due to the limited use of topical drug
applications on the skin in toxicity testing. Additionally, most CROs
have already transitioned to in-vitro technologies for testing dermal
toxicity instead of in-vivo for chemicals. 

The liver NAMs are classified as high TRL since they have high impact in
terms of cost and animal reduction and also they are widely being used
by pharma companies and CROs. The liver-on-chip model by Emulate Bio is
part of the FDA’s Innovative Science and Technology Approaches for New
Drugs (ISTAND) Pilot Program  while InSphero’s 3D liver spheroids have
been utilized in collaboration with the U.S. FDA for liver toxicity
studies. These advanced TRL liver NAMs are particularly valuable for
assessing hepatotoxicity and drug-induced liver injury (DILI), offering
significant potential for integration into drug development processes
within the Indian pharmaceutical sector. Therefore, we recommend the
adoption of these high TRL liver NAMs in the Indian pharmaceutical
context.

Apart from the liver, NAMs with lower TRL, particularly for the kidney,
lungs and heart require urgent focus. Technologies such as 2D invitro
cell culture models for lungs, 2D iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes and
insilico cardiotoxicity prediction tools have low complexity of adoption
and high impact in terms of cost reduction. Therefore the Indian pharma
industry should move towards adopting these NAMs in future.

7.10.3. Opportunities for replacement of animals in non-clinical studies

Currently, no opportunities are identified for the replacement of
animals with NAMs. There are no existing NAMs with immediate regulatory
approval. Therefore, it cannot be immediately integrated into regulatory
frameworks as replacements for key animal safety studies, as only
qualified models are permitted for use. However, in-vitro and in-silico
methods can be used in the initial phases of the drug discovery pipeline
for lead identification to reduce the number of animal studies
conducted.

**8. Cross-sectoral tests: Pyrogen testing  **

**Introduction **

Pyrogens are substances that can cause fever or in severe cases, septic
shock and death if introduced into the blood stream. The detection of
pyrogens is a critical step for assuring the quality and safety of
parental pharmaceuticals and medical devices. These pyrogens maybe
endotoxins, such as the lipopolysaccharides \[LPS\] of the outer cell
wall of Gram-negative bacteria or non-endotoxins, such as lipoteichoic
acid, muramyl peptides and peptidoglycans of Gram-positive bacteria,
fungal and viral components, and parasites. The pyrogenic contamination
is detected by peripheral blood monocytes and macrophages, which in turn
stimulate the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin
1β (IL-1β), TNF, and IL-6.  

 

Traditionally, the Rabbit pyrogen test (RPT) was used to test for
pyrogenic contamination. This test involved injecting the test substance
in upper ear vein of at least three rabbits, monitoring the body
temperature rectally, and a rise indicates pyrogenic contamination.
While this test can detect all pyorgenic contamination, the
disadvantages include that the condition under which the animals are
kept, and species of the rabbit can influence the results. Also,
non-injectible substances cannot be tested. Despite the fact that the
test was never formally validated<sup>1</sup>, it is still viewed as the
‘gold standard’ for pyrogen detection.  

 

In 1956, it was discovered that the Gram negative bacteria can cause
clotting of horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus) blood (haemolymph), and
that the LPS was the structural component responsible for this reaction.
This led to the development of Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate (LAL) test
<sup>2,3</sup>. In the LAL test, contact with endotoxins can trigger a
coagulation cascade with the activation of three pro-enzymes: Factor C,
Factor B and finally, pro-clotting enzyme. The three approved test
methods use LAL reagents for endotoxin testing, including Gel Clot
(limit and semi-quantitative), Turbidimetric, and Chromogenic (end-point
and kinetic methods) assays. All three assays are based on the principle
that the bacterial endotoxins can set off a cascade of reactions,
resulting in a change of turbidity or color. However, LAL test is
subject to false positives as haemolymph can also coagulate in vitro in
the presence of other substances that are harmless to humans, such as
salts with divalent cations, chelators, acids, antibiotics and proteins,
certain antibiotics, or non-andotixins, such as
β-D-glucan<sup>4,5</sup>. The horshoeshoe crab blood based lysate also
shows high batch-to-batch variability to due to variation found in the
natural lysate<sup>6</sup> In addition, the capture and bleeding
procedures also have an impact on horshoeshoe crab population, with a
mortality rate of 10-30%, and other impediments, such as decrease in
activity, speed and haemocyanin levels<sup>7</sup>. 

 

Based on the starting point of the coagulation cascade, Factor C, a
novel version of the LAL assay has been designed using a recombinant
form of Factor C. With this method, the need for horseshoe crab
hemolymph was eliminated. This test specifically recognises bacterial
endotoxin and is not influenced by non-endotoxins or sub substances that
can activate the alternate pathway, such as Factor G (which can lead to
false positives). In studies that compared the performance of LAL test
and rFC to detect pyrogen in purified pharmaceutical water matrices and
pharmaceutical products found that the rFC test showed better
performance, accuracy, repeatability and had a shorter time-to-results
<sup>8,9</sup>.

While the rFC test is specifically to detect bacterial endotoxins, the
monocyte activation test (MAT), which is based on detecting pyrogen
contamination represents the new generation pyrogen test by using human
whole blood and covering the detection of both endotoxins and
non-endotoxins. MAT can be performed using either human whole blood
(fresh or cryopreserved); b) with monocytic cells isolated from whole
blood (fresh or cryopreserved); and c) with monocytic cell lines. The
read-outs for the assay include three well-established proinflammatory
cytokines IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF that are detected using ELISA. As MAT uses
whole human blood, it is closest to reproducing the human reaction to
pyrogenic substances. While initially whole blood MAT was the only
variant that was available in the kit form, currently MAT kits that are
based on whole blood, cryopreserved whole blood, peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs), cryopreserved PBMCs, cell lines (MonoMac-6,
MM-6).  The PBMCs and whole blood assay (fresh and cryopreserved) have
been completely validated, cryopreserved PBMCs and cell lines are still
pending complete validation (Table 1). Due consideration needs to be
given to the challenges for maintaining the cooling chain for cryo PBMCs
while distributing to other labs/testing centres. With respect to the
cell lines, such MM-6, care needs to be taken towards genetic
variability and contamination.

8.2  Indian regulatory requirements for pyrogen testing 

The Indian pharmacopeia has brought in several changes to the IP in the
space of pyrogen testing (Figure 1).

In 2023, IPC released the [Draft
Proposal](https://www.ipc.gov.in/images/Guidelines_on_Bacterial_Endotoxins_Tests_Version_2.0_20.01.2023.pdf)
for comments to General Chapter Guidelines on the Bacterial Endotoxins
Tests. While the draft proposal did not include a specific mention of
alternative methods, such as rFC and MAT, it did include a section
titled ‘Alternative Test Method’ which included the following text, “The
methods mentioned in Bacterial Endotoxin (2.2.3.) for the detection of
bacterial endotoxins (Gel-clot limits test, semi quantitative gel-clot,
kinetic turbidimetric, kinetic chromogenic and endpoint chromogenic) are
considered to be validated. However, a laboratory may choose to use an
alternative method that is not mentioned in Bacterial Endotoxin
(2.2.3.). If such a choice is made, the alternate test for the detection
of bacterial endotoxins must be fully validated to ensure that decisions
made using the alternate methodology are equivalent to or better than
decisions made using the validated pharmacopoeial methods and ultimately
approved by the appropriate regulatory authority”. This incorporation
provides a window of opportunity for using the rFC and MAT tests for
endotoxin and pyrogen testing. 

 

In addition, an IP General chapter for Monocyte Activation Test was
introduced in IP 2018: 2.2.25​. This provides an indication of the
receptiveness of the IPC towards these new methods,

8.4 Challenges  

*a) Cost* 

Cost is currently a huge factor in the adoption of rFC and MAT tests.
There are a few commercially available vendors for the production of rFC
and MAT kits (listed below); however, the cost of the kits compared the
LAL gel clot method is a significant deterrent. 

 

Required: a cost analysis of indigenous production of rFC and MAT
compared to rFC and MAT kit pipeline 

 

*b) Standardisation challenges.* 

The MAT assay is based on whole blood or cryopreserved whole blood,
there may be donor-to-donor variability due to donor-specific blood
characteristics. Variability in cell lines can also affect
reproducibility and sensitivity. 

 

*c) Complexity* 

While the assay based on isolated monocytes or moncytic cell line would
exhibit less donor variabilities, the process of isolation, culture
maintenance, assay set-up etc requires a controlled laboratory setup,
trained personnel. In addition, specialized equipment is required for
cytokine analysis for the MAT test. 

 

*d) Time factor* 

MAT is more time-intensive than LAL due to the need for cytokine release
and detection steps. 

 

 

*e) Training* 

Adopting MAT test requires hands-on training and currently no private or
government lab in India provides such training. Also, there is a lack of
clarity of use for different technologies that are available under MAT​. 

6.5 Key Recommendations 

a\) Production of indigenous reagents associated with the rFC and MAT
tests to reduce the costs 

Currently all the reagents, such IL-6, recombinant proteins etc are not
manufactured in India. Importing these reagents raises the cost of the
kit and assay in general. 

 

b\) Ensuring a continuous supply chain for the kits/reagents 

As there are very few vendors in this space, if a company validates
their product using a specific kit from a vendor, there is a fear that
if the company stops its operation in India, it would be difficult to
switch to another company/vendor leading the revalidation process. This
would further effect the production of the company. Thus, ensuring
uninterrupted supply of reagents/kit/products from key vendors and
having more players/suppliers in the market would be critical to build
the confidence in adoption of these methods. 

c\) Mapping the market size of pyrogen testing in India 

Mapping the end-user market of pyrogen testing would be very critical to
understand the impact the indigenisation of these technologies would
have on India. Ultimately, higher demand would assist in bringing down
the cost, and this exercise would help in tapping this sector. This
mapping would also incentivise the Indian start-ups and companies to
invest in this space. 

d\) Documentation of the global standardisation efforts of these tests 

As standardisation of the assays, including the types that uses whole
blood and cell lines for MAT assays would be essential to reduce the
variability and increase consistency of production. Documenting and
increasing access to the global efforts in this direction, including
guidelines by WHO, EDQM etc could help in this direction.

**9. Vaccines **

9.1 Background (Global and Indian - market size and number of
approvals) 

India has emerged as a key bulk vaccine manufacturer in the recent times
and contributes to nearly 60 percent of the world's vaccines. Indian
vaccine manufacturing companies are big suppliers to the UN agencies,
and account for 60-80% of the vaccines it buys every year. Apart from
the mass-manufacturing of vaccines, India has also been successful in
creating or modifying a whole new range of vaccines indigenously. 

Serum Institute of India (Pune)’s share of global volume, excluding
COVID-19 vaccines, increased from 19% in 2021 to 24% in 2022, driven by
significant increase in volumes of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, MR
and Td (Measles, Rubella, Tetanus, Diptheria) -containing vaccines
(Figure 1). This makes it have the largest market share globally. The
current market is highly dependent on only nine manufacturers of
vaccines that have more than five vaccines and distribute vaccines
globally. Of these manufacturers that provided approximately 70% of
global supply in 2022 (excluding COVID-19 vaccines) three are located in
India (Fig 2).

There are 25 vaccine-manufacturing companies in the private sector,
including the MNCs and indigenous manufacturers. The MNCs, such as GSK
and Sanofi, primarily import vaccines and repackage them for sales in
India<sup>1</sup>, whereas, the indigenous manufacturers perform wide
range of activities, including vaccine development and manufacturing.
Currently, 24 types of vaccines are manufactured by the private sector.
These include Serum Institute of India (16), followed by Shantha Biotech
(acquired by Sanofi in 2009) (9), Bharat Biotech (7), Panacea Biotech
(7), and Biological E (6). The public sector manufactures around 10
traditional types of vaccines including, DPT, DT, TT, JE, YF, OPV, BCG,
Measle, Hep-B, and and Modern Safe Tissue Culture based Rabies Vaccine
(TCARV).  Several private companies manufacture basic vaccines covered
under the Universal Immunisation Program (UIP) and other vaccines, such
as anti-rabies, Hep-B, Hib, Pentavalent vaccines (Figure 3).

Currently, animal testing is done during the research and development of
new vaccines to evaluate the quality and quantity of immune responses;
and to determine the efficiency of translation of results observed
during preclinical stages. They are also used for ensuring the quality,
safety, and potency of each batch of established vaccines, also referred
to as batch testing.  

In this report, we cover the non-animal methods that have been developed
and accepted by global regulatory bodies, for testing the safety and
potency of vaccines, specifically in the batch testing space, but yet to
be adopted by the Indian pharmacopeia. We also cover cases where
non-animal methods are currently in the process of development and
validation and may be available in the next 3-10 years. We also cover
current challenges in the adoption of NAMs in the Indian vaccine
ecosystem and provide possible product-specific recommendations that
could enable the adoption of NAMs in the batch testing area in the
coming decade. 

 

 

9.2 Methodology (exact regulations cited and stakeholders consulted) 

The different pharmacopeia’s, including EU, Indian and WHO guidelines
were looked into for developing this chapter. There are several stages
of batch testing which are mentioned in the following sections. These
terminologies are defined below: 

 

- *Master seed lot*: This is the original, high-quality,
  well-characterized strain of the virus, bacteria, or toxoid used to
  produce the vaccine. 

<!-- -->

- *Working seed lot*: This is derived from the master seed lot but is
  expanded into larger quantities for actual vaccine production. 

<!-- -->

- *Bulk purified toxoid*: The processed purified material prepared from
  either a single harvest or a pool of a number of single harvests. It
  is the parent material from which the final bulk is prepared. The bulk
  purified toxoid is only used for Diphtheria (D) and Tetanus (T)
  vaccines and other combination vaccines that contain Diphtheria and/or
  Tetanus toxoid. 

<!-- -->

- *Final bulk* - The homogeneous final vaccine presents in a single
  container from which the final containers are filled either directly
  or through one or more intermediate containers. A collection of sealed
  final containers that are homogeneous with respect to the risk of
  contamination during filling. A final lot must therefore have been
  filled from a single container in one continuous working session. 

<!-- -->

- *Final lot:* This includes testing of the fully formulated and
  packaged vaccine. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9.3 Non-animal methods to test safety and potency of vaccines during
batch testing   

In this section, we cover the NAMs that have been developed, validated
and accepted by one or more regulatory agencies, such as European
Pharmacopeia (Eu Ph) and/or WHO (Table 1). In addition, we also cover
tests, where validations are currently underway by global stakeholders
and the NAM may be available for wider adoption in the next 3-10 years
(Table 2)

9.5 Challenges (cost, scientific validity etc) 

Despite the availability of validated NAMs for certain vaccines, there
still remain some challenges for their wider adoption in the Indian
ecosystem that are discussed below: 

*a) Access to reagents and antibodies* 

Many of the newer methods, require access to reagents and antibodies to
conduct the validation studies. In some cases, such as the antibodies
for conducting ELISA for DT are being freely provided to stakeholders by
the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA, UK).
Awareness amongst the stakeholders regarding the possible vendors,
companies, or organizations from where the reagents could be procured
could be helpful. 

*b) Ensuring continuous supply of newer test kits/supply chain* 

As there are fewer companies supply the in vitro kits/reagents required
for the same, there is a fear that possible cessation of their supply
could have a massive impact on the logistics of production, requiring
revalidation and reapprovals using a different product/vendor. Thus,
there is a need to ensure seamless and consistent supply for the in
vitro kits and reagents to enable greater adoption. 

*c) Access to protocols, SOPs, and troubleshooting guidelines* 

Many of the stakeholders who are currently in the process of validating
these methods in house looked towards existing SOPs/ standardisation
protocols already developed globally or by Indian companies 

*d) Infrastructure and cost* 

Certain methods, like the Next Generation Sequencing for adventitious
agents testing and neurovirulence test require considerable effort to
set up an in-house infrastructure for the same. In addition, NGS and
other assays like the MAT test would also require greater monetary
investment compared to animal assays if buying the test kits from a
vendor. 

*e) Complexity* 

For many methods, like the NGS and MAT test require specific training
and expertise compared to the animal test. This also adds a layer to
impediment to greater adoption.

10. **Ecosystem level recommendations**

**The Three Ecosystems Approach**[^3]

This report deals primarily with three different ecosystems with each
ecosystem being composed of a diverse set of stakeholders.

1.  **Ecosystem 1:** Sectors where there are clearly available 3R
    opportunities (generics, biosimilars, cell and gene therapies,
    vaccines, NCEs and NBEs).

2.  **Ecosystem 2:** Drug development sector (NAMs).

3.  **Ecosystem 3:** Post-release sector (MAT, rCR and rFC).

Ecosystem level recommendations for each of these three are likely to
vary significantly.

**Ecosystem 1: Sectors with existing 3R opportunities**

**Key stakeholders in Ecosystem 1:**

alt="A diagram of a company AI-generated content may be incorrect." />

Fig 1. Key Stakeholders in Ecosystem 1

**Key recommendations:**

1.  Creation of an **industry consortium** to bring together key
    industry players in these sectors to collectively advocate for the
    3Rs.

The consortium will have the following **functions**:

1.  Awareness generation about the benefits of moving away from animal
    testing: reduction of costs; increased ability to invest in more
    human-relevant research methods; etc. within the pharmaceutical
    industry. For instance, the U.S. NTP Interagency Center for the
    Evaluation of Alternative Toxicological Methods (NICEATM) conducts
    workshops and webinars on the 3Rs approach.[^4]

2.  Focus on creating more awareness about 3R opportunities within the
    phar maceutical industry in India by collating and disseminating
    best practices that have already been/can be adopted to reduce the
    number of animal tests.

3.  Leverage the Indian Pharmaceutical Association (IPA) to encourage
    more and more pharmaceutical companies to reduce their dependence on
    animal testing by making them aware of the potential cost-savings
    that the shift could entail.

4.  Collectively approach regulators to advocate for reduction and
    replacement opportunities by seeking meetings, submitting
    representations, and inviting them to workshops and webinars
    organised by the Consortium.

<!-- -->

2.  Civil society groups (like Humane World for Animals) could advocate
    for greater data transparency from agencies like the Committee for
    Control and Supervision of Experiments on Animals (CCSEA) as far as
    the extent and nature of experimentation on animals is concerned.

> The availability of this data will help shape public opinion and
> thereby create more public pressure on the pharmaceutical industry as
> well as regulators to explore and utilise the available 3R
> opportunities.

Fig 3. Overall representation of Key Ecosystem Recommendations

**Years 1 and 2**

1.  **Set up Centres of Excellence (CoEs) based on a hub and spoke
    model.**

**Rationale:**

Establishing dedicated Centres of Excellence (CoEs) can accelerate the
development and adoption of NAMs by offering specialised infrastructure,
training, and validation services.

**Global examples:** Organ‐on‐a‐chip models developed by research groups
at Harvard’s Wyss Institute have demonstrated human‐relevant
physiological responses, offering a powerful alternative to animal
experiments.[^5] The Fraunhofer Institute in Germany hosts translational
medicine hubs that provide fee‐based testing, bridging academic
innovation and industrial needs.[^6]

**Key functions:**

1.  Creation of basic infrastructure for catalysing NAMs : The CoEs can
    accelerate the transition towards NAMs by offering infrastructure
    such as, cell repositories, state-of-the-art resources with
    high-throughput screening systems, organ-on-chip devices and
    subscription to industry-verified computation models and data
    systems.[^7]

2.  Function as cell repositories: Indigenous establishment of high
    quality and well-validated cell repository as a CoE for primary
    cells for liver, hepatocytes, and cells from different genetic
    backgrounds with the cell repository being a hub with multiple
    spokes.

3.  Generate awareness on NAMs: Organise sectoral and cross-sectoral
    events through awareness programs to highlight the benefits of using
    NAMs technologies in drug development and build industry-academia
    partnerships to facilitate technology transfer and validation of
    NAMs. The programmes can provide valuable data on expectations,
    barriers and opportunities for each stakeholder involved. Awareness
    of NAMs to the general public and other relevant stakeholders can be
    done through strategic dissemination of information through media
    campaigns, collaborations and engaging the public.

4.  Encourage innovation: Globally, many key players in the NAMs space
    have emerged from academic settings. (Examples: TissUse,[^8] Emulate
    Bio,[^9] Mimetas,[^10] and Nortis.[^11]).

5.  Provision of services: Academic labs (designated as CoEs) can adopt
    a service-provider model to ensure their financial viability and
    reduce dependence on grants. They can provide fee‐based testing
    services, form contract research modules, and consulting services to
    the industry to monetise their research.

6.  Enable skill development: CoEs can conduct workshops and short‐term
    certificate courses on NAMs to create a skilled workforce.

7.  Facilitate industry-academia and government-academia partnerships.

8.  Serve as validation centres.

Fig 4. Proposed Hub and Spokes of the Centre of Excellence

For NAMs-dedicated Centre of Excellence in India, the central hub would
house state-of-the-art facilities and serve as the authority for
protocol validation and regulatory engagement, while the spokes, located
at leading academic institutions and research centres would focus on
niche areas such as computational toxicology and organ‐on‐chip
technologies. Research from Harvard[^12] and MIT Sloan[^13] demonstrates
that this model enhances operational efficiency and fosters
cross-disciplinary collaboration, making it an ideal strategy to
accelerate the adoption of human-relevant testing methods in India.

In the proposed CoE, the following iteration of the Hub and Spoke Model
is proposed:

**Central Hub (Core CoE):**

State‐of‐the‐art resources: Large‐scale laboratories equipped with
high‐throughput screening systems, organ‐on‐chip devices, and data
repositories. The hub could define research agendas, manage
collaborations (with industry, academia, regulators), and ensure quality
control.

**Spoke Institutions (Specialised Labs):**

1.  Research and innovation spokes: Located in IITs or national labs
    focusing on specialised NAMs research, e.g., computational
    toxicology.

2.  Training and education spokes: Offer workshops, certification
    courses, and skill development programs for both academic and
    industry professionals.

**Funding mechanism:**

Initially, the CoEs would be funded through government grants from
institutions like BIRAC. Philanthropic funding from organisations like
Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation can also be explored for funding
opportunities. As the CoEs become more established, they can become
financially independent by providing services or pivoting towards
becoming startups in the NAMs sector.

**Implementation Plan:**

**Short‐Term (Years 1 and 2)**

1.  Identify institutions that could potentially be designated at CoEs
    by the DBT under its Centres of Excellence and Innovation in
    Biotechnology (CEIB) programme. These institutions can be supported
    by organisations like CPHMS to apply for this programme and secure
    initial funding.

2.  Develop MoUs and Funding Proposals: Engage with leading academic
    institutions (IITs, IISc), industry leaders (pharma and biotech
    companies), and government agencies to formalise partnerships.

3.  Prepare and submit grant proposals to national funding bodies (ICMR,
    DBT, Department of Science & Technology) and explore PPP models to
    secure seed funding.

4.  Launch pilot projects: Conduct a limited series of NAM assays and
    training modules, ensuring documentation of processes and outcomes
    to build a repository of best practices.

5.  Stakeholder engagement workshops: Organise seminars, workshops, and
    webinars involving academic researchers, regulators, and industry
    representatives to share pilot data and refine technical priorities.

**Medium‐Term (Years 3 and 4)**

1.  Develop into service providers: Develop specialised technologies
    that can first be tested by academic labs, and then sent to CROs for
    validation.

2.  Develop advanced training programmes: Roll out comprehensive
    certification courses and hands-on workshops on computational
    toxicology and organ‐on‐chip technologies. Establish continuous
    professional development tracks for faculty and industry
    practitioners.

3.  Strengthen regulatory and academic ties through collaborative
    research papers and case studies emphasising on creating larger
    dialogues surrounding NAMs in India.

4.  Establish regular feedback mechanisms: Set up a dedicated regulatory
    liaison cell to meet periodically with CDSCO and other stakeholders,
    addressing concerns and updating protocols based on emerging global
    standards.

5.  Monitoring and reporting: Develop an online dashboard to track
    performance metrics, service uptake, and validation milestones. This
    tool will enhance transparency and facilitate data-driven regulatory
    discussions that will then be fed to the Central Agency Database
    from year 5.

**Long‐Term (Year 5 onwards)**

1.  Achieve National Validation Hub status: Standardisation and
    Accreditation: Collaborate with CDSCO, CPCSEA, and international
    bodies (OECD, ECVAM) to standardise NAMs protocols. One of the goals
    for the CoE could be aiming for ISO and OECD GLP accreditation to
    position the CoE as a national reference lab.

2.  Scale up and strengthen collaborative networks: Collaborate in
    inter‐laboratory validation studies with organisations like ECVAM or
    ICCVAM, further raising India’s global profile.

3.  Expand the Hub-and-Spoke model: Add more specialised spokes in
    prioritised, emerging areas by collaborating with additional
    research institutions and start-ups.

**Years 3 and 4**

2.  **Establish a Consortium to catalyse the development and subsequent
    adoption of NAMs.**

**Rationale:**

Globally, Consortiums have played a significant role in propelling NAMs
technologies further. (Example: International Consortium for Innovation
and Quality in Pharmaceutical Development (IQMPS)). In its roadmap to
accelerate the maturation of NAMs in the country, Australia has also
proposed setting up of a Consortium.

**Key functions:**

1.  Provide a common platform for industry, academia and regulatory
    players to collaborate for catalysing development and adoption of
    NAMs technologies through:

- Collective advocacy - particularly act as a bridge between
  industry/academia on the one hand, and government departments (like
  DBT) and regulatory bodies (like CDSCO and RCGM) on the other.

- Coordinate resource pooling among Consortium members.

- Capacity building and skill development.

2.  Facilitate public-private and industry-academia partnerships for
    NAMs development. **Global examples**: Emulate, Inc. entered into a
    Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the FDA
    to enable multiple studies across FDA offices in priority research
    areas, including programs to evaluate COVID-19 vaccines and
    understand human immune response against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that
    causes COVID-19. This new CRADA agreement was based on the
    successful completion of the first Emulate CRADA with the FDA
    initiated in 2017[^14] that focused on toxicity studies using
    Liver-Chip. The FDA and CN Bio, a leading organ-on-a-chip company
    (OOC) that designs and manufactures single and multi-organ
    microphysiological systems (MPS) have collaborated twice.[^15]

3.  Validation of NAMs: Through identification of labs working on NAMs
    in India, the consortium can collate information and priority areas
    of technologically ready NAMs and begin validation efforts by
    encouraging the development of technologies meeting global
    scientific and regulatory standards. The IQMPS Consortium is a
    global example wherein the Consortium also facilitates the
    Qualification of Micro Physiological Models from the Industry.[^16]

4.  Mobilisation of funding for development of NAMs by the academia and
    industry through philanthropic funding agencies like BMGF. **Global
    example:** The NIH conducted a Common Fund Complement Animal
    Research in Experimentation Compliment-ARIE crowdsourcing
    competition to drive innovation in NAMs.[^17]
    <span class="mark"></span>

5.  <span class="mark">Encourage adoption and development of NAMs by
    CROs and the pharmaceutical industry: Through engagement with
    multiple stakeholders, barriers to adoption can be identified. Post
    this, CROs can be incentivised through awareness programmes like
    High-throughput Screening methods as incorporated by NCRIS in
    Australia.</span>[^18] <span class="mark">Programmes like the
    National Tech Startup Policy under the</span> Office of the
    Principal Scientific Advisor can be leveraged to provide a robust
    starting point to encourage CROs in adopting NAMs.

6.  <span class="mark">Identify labs that have the potential to develop
    competitive NAMs technologies and promote the indigenous development
    and manufacturing of NAMs technologies by facilitating global
    partnerships and providing funding.</span>

7.  Advocacy for policy reform: Advocate for the revision of testing
    guidelines and for regulatory acceptance of data generated through
    validated NAMs. The U.S., through the FDA Modernization Act 2.0, has
    removed the requirement for mandatory animal testing for drug
    development,[^19] encouraging the adoption of NAMs technologies. The
    Consortium can lead the movement in India towards release of
    guidelines, guidance documents, etc. by engaging with the regulatory
    bodies like CDSCO and DCGI.

**Proposed structure:**

General Body - composed of all members.

Governing Body - elected by the general body. Functions: overseeing
operations, monitoring progress, resource allocation to Working Groups,
and decision-making

Working Groups - set up by the Governing Body for specific purposes.
Example: Validation Working Group.

**Funding mechanism:** government grants, industry contributions,
philanthropic funding, and provision of services.

**Implementation Plan:**

**Phase 1 - Year 1**

Approach key players in industry and academia to convince them about the
need for a Consortium and form a Consortium Steering Committee.

**Phase 2 - Year 2 onwards**

1.  The Steering Committee works together to mobilise funding to enable
    formation of the Consortium and add more members.

2.  Once there are a sufficient number of members, a governing body is
    elected.

3.  The Consortium is registered as a legal entity.

4.  The Governing Body develops governance framework and operational
    guidelines.

5.  Programmes for implementation are identified and prioritised. We
    recommend that the Consortium undertake awareness generation and
    skill development activities in its first year of operation.

6.  The Consortium could also identify specific technology areas for
    indigenous development of NAMs through an assessment of existing
    NAMs providers in the country, global developments, and market-size
    assessments for different types of technologies.

**Year 5 onwards**

3.  **Create a Central Agency for NAMs.**

**Rationale:**

The FDA’s proposed central NAMs office represents a strategic shift from
a fragmented approach towards methodical validation and implementation
with respect to NAMs.

**Key functions:**

1.  Establishment of validation centres modelled on EURL ECVAM (European
    Union Reference Laboratory for Alternatives to Animal Testing[^20]
    and JaCVAM (Japanese Center for the Validation of Alternative
    Methods)[^21].

2.  Establishment of knowledge database, acting as a central repository
    for NAMs efforts and tests, following FAIR principles (Findable,
    Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable), similar to the FDA’s approach
    (FDA ISTAND, 2021).

3.  Ensuring data transparency and metrics tracking functions by
    establishing a centralised, FAIR-compliant database to track NAMs
    adoption rates, adoption rates, reductions in animal use, and
    industry uptake, analogous to systems implemented by EURL
    ECVAM[^22].

4.  Promote increased adoption of NAMs by pharmaceutical companies
    through consistent dissemination of studies, programmes and
    workshops highlighting the Omics of adoption of NAMs and other

5.  Encourage indigenous development and manufacturing of NAMs through
    developing more financial pathways in the private sector in
    partnership with the Central Agency to develop a phased approach
    (such as Make in India and the Draft National Deep Tech Startup
    Policy) in creating a sustainable indigenous manufacturing ecosystem
    for NAMs technologies. These programmes may offer economic benefits
    to industry stakeholders, opportunities for academia, CROs and
    start-ups to funnel a holistic recognition of the benefits of
    indigenous manufacturing. International examples include the PRIME
    programme[^23] run by EMA and the EMULATE’s Cooperative Research and
    Development Agreement (CRADA) with FDA[^24] to enable multiple
    studies across FDA offices in priority research areas.

**Proposed structure:**

The proposed Central Agency could be set up as an autonomous institution
under the CDSCO.

**Funding mechanism:**

The Central Agency, being a government body, will need to be entirely
funded by the government.

**Implementation Plan:**

**Phase I : Year 1**

1.  The agency is established by the government as an autonomous body
    under the CDSCO with a detailed policy framework outlining the
    agency’s legal authority, organisational structure, funding
    mechanisms, and key operational functions. This can either be done
    through an executive decision or through an amendment to the Drugs
    and Cosmetics Act, 1940.

2.  The agency establishes data management frameworks: The Central
    Agency works on developing NAMs data repositories. Global example:
    The ALTBIB, which stands for the Bibliography on Alternatives to the
    Use of Live Vertebrates in Biomedical Research and Testing, gives
    access to the latest research in in vitro and computational methods
    via PubMed. It also provides links to resources on alternative
    research methods and acceptance.[^25]

**Phase II: Year 2 onwards**

1.  Release guidelines to enable increased adoption of NAMs. Release
    parallel guidance documents for ecosystem stakeholders enabling
    transition.

2.  Complete integration of national NAMs database, publishing and
    collation of reports tracking NAMs adoption, internationally
    validated method usage and animal testing reduction metrics.

3.  Enhance India’s international competitiveness by aligning Indian
    regulatory standards with global benchmarks (OECD/EU).

4.  Initiate national certification efforts for NAMs Laboratories (CROs
    included) to ensure adherence to internationally accepted standards,
    e.g, OECD, GLP and ISO.

5.  Begin delivering structured training and certification programmes to
    regulatory staff, industry professionals, and academic researchers
    by coordinating efforts with the established CoEs.

6.  Initiate formal dialogues with international NAMs organisations
    (e.g. OECD, EURL ECVAM, FDA) to harmonise validation protocols and
    regulatory standards.

**Ecosystem 3: Post-release sector (MAT, rCR and rFC)**

**Key stakeholders in Ecosystem 3:**

alt="A diagram of a company AI-generated content may be incorrect." />

Fig 5. Key Stakeholders for Post-Release

**Key recommendations:**

1.  Awareness generation within the pharmaceutical industry about the
    availability and benefits of alternatives to Rabbit Pyrogen Test and
    Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate (LAL) test through workshops and webinars.
    This function can be performed by the Consortia that have been
    recommended as part of Ecosystems 1 and 2.

2.  Even though the Indian Pharmacopoeia (IP) General chapter for
    Monocyte Activation Test was introduced in IP 2018: 2.2.25​, detailed
    guidelines from the IP on how it can be used by the pharmaceutical
    industry could propel greater adoption of this technology. This
    function can be performed by the Consortia that have been
    recommended as part of Ecosystems 1 and 2.

3.  Production of indigenous reagents associated with the rFC, rCR, and
    MAT tests to reduce the costs of adoption by the industry
    (pharmaceutical companies and CROs).

4.  Ensuring a continuous supply chain for the kits/reagents.

5.  Documentation of the global standardisation efforts of these tests:
    As standardisation of the assays, including the types that use whole
    blood and cell lines for MAT assays, would be essential to reduce
    the variability and increase consistency of production. Documenting
    and increasing access to the global efforts in this direction,
    including guidelines by WHO, EDQM etc. could help in this direction.
