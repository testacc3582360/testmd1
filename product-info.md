**Chapter 4: Non-animal Methodologies (NAMs) for drug testing**

**4.1 Background (Global and Indian - market size and number of
approvals)**

Animal testing has been the backbone of preclinical studies for drug
development. Both rodent and non-rodent models are used to
assess systemic as well as tissue specific toxicity, efficacy and
pharmacokinetics of a particular drug **<sup>1</sup>**. For example,
dermal toxicity assessments of a drug involves *invivo* skin irritation
assays in rabbits like the Draize skin irritation
assay<sup>2</sup>.<sup>.</sup>However, these models often fail to
recapitulate the complexity of human biological systems specifically in
the context of organ-specific toxicity and disease-specific
responses<sup>3</sup>,<sup>4</sup>. Only 10% of the drug development
projects make it from phase 1 to
approval<sup>5</sup>,<sup>6</sup>,<sup>7</sup>. This results in delay in
the delivery of safe and effective therapies to patients<sup>8</sup>.
The animal models fail to recapitulate the complexity of human system
due to species-specific difference in physiology, metabolism and
genetics between animals and human which leads to discrepancies in
data<sup>9</sup>. For example, the poor translational response of mouse
model to human diseases is due to the complexity of the human disease,
the inbred nature of the mouse model, the use of single mechanistic
models, the differences in cellular composition between mouse and human
tissues **<sup>9</sup>**. This results in failure of clinical
trials<sup>10</sup>,<sup>11</sup>. These challenges emphasize on the
urgent need for innovative and human-centric non-animal testing
platforms.

Because of this, over the last few decades, there have been a number of
global regulatory developments to promote non-animal methodologies. The
main attention has been given to the 3R principles (replacement,
reduction, refinement of animal use) with more focus on tests that
reduce the use of animals .This has been mandated by the Directive
2010/63/EU and seen in the recent EU resolution ([TA
MEF](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2021-0387_EN.pdf))
and actions<sup>12,13</sup>.

The adoption of Non-Animal Methods or New Approach Methodologies (NAMs)
is revolutionizing the field of drug discovery and toxicity assessment
by offering more human-relevant, ethical and scientifically advanced
alternatives to traditional animal testing<sup>14</sup>.NAMs leverage
technologies such as 2D invitro cultures, 3D organoids,3D organ-on-chips
and computational modelling to address the limitations of animal testing
(Fig 1). NAMs can reduce animal testing in the non-clinical domain. For
example, in September 2024, FDA’s CDER accepted Emulate Bio’s liver on
chip into their ISTAND (Innovative Science and Technology Approaches for
New Drugs pilot program). The ISTAND Pilot Program accepts submissions
for qualification of types of drug development tools (DDTs) that are out
of scope for existing DDT qualification programs but may still be
beneficial for drug development. This liver on chip can be used to
predict DILI for different therapeutic drugs<sup>15</sup>.

The global NAMs testing market size has grown rapidly in recent years. A
report from the business research company published in January 2025
estimated that the NAMs market will grow from \$ 2.33 billion in 2024 to
\$ 2.6 billion in 2025. This growth is due to i) increasing cost of
animal studies ii) increased adoption of such technologies iii)
increased investment towards NAMs iv) increased research grants for NAMs
v) increased social awareness against animal cruelty. 

(<u><https://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/report/non-animal-alternatives-testing-global-market-report>
)</u>

Many major pharmaceutical players in the field of NAMs are spin off from
academic institutions. For example, TissUse from Technische University
Berlin, Emulate Bio from Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired
Engineering in Boston, Mimetas from Leiden University and Nortis from
University of Washington. Other suppliers licensed MPS technologies from
academia. For example, CN Bio licensing the PhysioMimix platform from
the Massachusetts Institute of technology (MIT) in Cambridge, InSphero
licensing the tissue plate platform from the ETH in Zurich and Hesperos
using the technology developed at Cornell University. This indicates a
collaborative approach between academia and industry<sup>16</sup>**.**

This chapter provides insight into the key global industry players in
NAMs. Some of these global industry players collaborate directly with
international regulatory agencies like US FDA to validate new
approaches. Studying these global industry players is essential because
these technologies can help to align bridge studies conducted by Indian
pharma companies with global regulatory standards making them more
streamlined, scientifically sound and accepted by regulatory agencies.
This chapter lists NAMs and their application in tissue specific
toxicity and efficacy studies with main focus on their strengths,
limitations. This study also lists recommendations for accelerating NAMs
adoption by the Indian pharmaceutical industry, CROs and academicians.

**4.2 Methodology (exact regulations cited and stakeholders consulted)**

A detailed list of major industry players in NAMs was created after
curating the websites of global industry players (attached in
supplementary document 1) which was validated by multiple stakeholders
(Table 1). Recommendations (specifically in an Indian context) for the
adoption of NAMs were made after consulting with these stakeholders. The
detailed methodology listed is as follows: (The flowchart for the
methodology is given in Fig 2)

**4.2.1. Analysing company websites, application notes and
publications**

Detailed information from manufacturers like AxoSim, Tissuse, Emulate
Bio, inSphero, EPISKIN, etc about their products/ technologies were
analyzed. This includes information on tissue-specific applications, the
disease model studied, the endpoints evaluated, type of cells used, the
type of NAMs, etc. Documents containing information on how NAMs are
applied in real-world scenarios including methodologies, protocols and
outcomes for specific use cases like drug toxicity, absorption, and
metabolism studies were collected and reviewed. These documents are
catalogued in specific folders (tissue-wise categorization of folders).
Publications that serve as validation reports, detailing experimental
outcomes and supporting the usage of NAM technologies were analyzed.
Over 122 company websites were curated and over 400 publications were
reviewed and analyzed.

**4.2.2. Compiling a list of industry- players in NAMs for
tissue-specific toxicity**

NAMs based on their application to specific tissues or organs such as
the liver, heart, skin, eye, kidney, intestine, lungs and nervous system
were listed in Supplementary document 1 and in Tables 2-9. The list
included information on whether the model is 2D, 3D or *insilico*, the
type of cells or materials used, and the *invitro* endpoints measured.
The models that meet global regulatory guidelines, e.g., OECD, FDA, and
ICH guidelines were identified ensuring relevance for preclinical
testing and regulatory submissions​​. The names, websites and contact
details of manufacturers, along with any supporting publications or
application notes were included in the list​​.

We have classified these NAMs based on their technology readiness level
(TRL) considering i) their complexity of adoption ii) their overall
impact including cost efficiency, reduction in animal usage iii) status
of their approval by regulatory agencies and iv) their scalability and
usage.

**4.2.3. Engaging stakeholders for input**

We engaged in discussions with key stakeholders to validate and refine
the list of industry players in NAMs. This was a critical step to ensure
their adoption in the Indian market. The stakeholders were consulted to
validate the list as well as provide recommendations to increase
adoption of NAMs in the Indian market. The following group of
stakeholders were consulted (Table 1 shows the details of the
stakeholders consulted):

1.  Pharmaceutical companies

2.  Contract Research Organizations (CROs)

3.  Academicians and researchers

4.  Toxicologists

NAMs.

**4.3. NAMs in toxicity testing and their applications**

In this section we have highlighted the key industry players in NAMs
for tissue specific toxicity studies. Accordingly, the applications of
NAMs have been divided into type of toxicity testing including Dermal,
hepatic, renal, respiratory, CNS, cardiac, intestinal and ocular The
usage of NAMs in these areas are more relevant to humans and can also
lead to a potential reduction in the number of animals being used for
preclinical studies. The detailed list of the industry players is
provided in Supplementary document 1. This document contains details of
the respective companies, the NAMs that are being used to study the
tissue specific toxicity, the in vitro end points being studied, the
application of NAMs, the type of cells being used and the list of
corresponding publications.

**4.3.1. Hepatic toxicity testing**

The animal models to study hepatic toxicity, for example, idiosyncratic
DILI is difficult to reproduce in human. There are species specific
differences in metabolism between mice, rats, monkeys, dogs and humans.
For example, animals express homologs of cytochrome P450 in humans. All
the homologs of P450 do not have the same substrate specificity. While
mice show increased similarity of P450 activity to humans, rats show
less similarity<sup>17</sup>. This leads to preclinical failure of drugs
and poses a challenge in using animal models for predicting liver
toxicity in humans accurately. Therefore, application of NAMs in hepatic
toxicity testing holds a great potential for the pharma industry in the
drug development field. The *invivo* endpoints for liver toxicity are
DILI assessment. Parameters used to measure these endpoints are blood
biomarkers (ALT, AST, etc.), histopathology and clinical/behavioral
observations. The *invitro* endpoints for liver toxicity are assessment
of DILI by measuring the cell viability, release of hepatic enzymes like
cytochrome P450, measuring the Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) activity,
Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) activity and oxidative stress
markers<sup>12</sup>.

We have identified 26 global industry players in hepatic NAMs. The list
of hepatic NAMs are provided in Table 2 (A detailed list containing
details of the respective companies, the NAMs that are being used to
study the tissue specific toxicity, the *invitro* end points being
studied, the application of NAMs, the type of cells being used and the
list of corresponding publications is provided in Supplementary document
1). The Key regulatory guidelines ensuring the reliability of liver
toxicity studies using NAMs is the FDA Guidance on In Vitro
Methods<sup>18</sup>.

One of the companies that works in the field of liver NAMs is Emulate
Bio. In September 2024, FDA’s CDER accepted Emulate Bio’s liver on chip
into their ISTAND pilot program. This liver on chip is made of human
hepatocytes, human stellate cells, epithelial cells, extracellular
matrix, immune cells, endothelial cells, endothelial channel and can be
used to predict DILI for different therapeutic drugs. Ewing et al in
2024 has demonstrated the toxicology and pharmacology of cannabidol
(CBD) for the first time using these liver-on-chip systems. By measuring
the levels of ALT, miR-122 and Cyt P450 enzymes using these
micro-physiological systems, they showed the potential of these systems
to translate data into clinical studies<sup>15</sup>. InSphero, another
company working in the field of liver NAMs have developed liver
microtissues (consisting of primary hepatocytes and non-parenchymal
liver cells) which can be used for DILI prediction. In 2021, InSphero
launched a consortium in collaboration with key pharmaceutical companies
like Pfizer, Sanofi, Merck and Genentech for drug testing to predict
DILI. InSphero in collaboration with FDA NCTR published a study in 2024
where they tested 152 FDA approved drugs for hepatotoxicity using these
microtissues<sup>19</sup>**.** These studies indicate that these
advanced technologies provide robust tools for evaluating liver toxicity
ensuring safer pharmaceuticals and reducing reliance on animal studies.

To accelerate the adoption of these techniques by Indian pharmaceutical
companies, there is a need to develop scientifically validated sources
of cell lines like primary hepatocytes, human stellate cells, epithelial
cells, endothelial cells, non-parenchymal liver cells and HepG2 cell
lines <sup>20</sup>. Therefore, the establishment of indigenous biobank
is necessary in the context of Indian drug development.

**4.3.2. Renal toxicity testing**

Kidney plays an important role in filtration, reabsorption and
excretion. This makes them highly susceptible to the toxic effects of
drugs. About 19-33% of acute kidney injury cases are due to drug
nephrotoxicity<sup>21</sup>. Therefore, renal toxicity testing becomes
an essential component of drug safety evaluation. The *invivo* endpoints
to detect renal toxicity for drugs includes urinary volume, specific
gravity, osmolality, pH, fluid/electrolyte balance, proteins, cytology,
evaluation of biomarkers of nephrotoxicity and blood chemistry
determinations such as blood urea nitrogen, creatinine and plasma
proteins (ICH S7A guidelines). These animal studies are expensive, have
low-throughput and are time-consuming and lower human
reproducibility<sup>22</sup>. Therefore, animal studies to predict renal
toxicity leads to 8% to 9% drug failure in preclinical and clinical
stages of drug development<sup>21</sup>,**<sup>23</sup>**. The use of
NAMs for this purpose can provide human-relevant alternatives that
enhance the accuracy of prediction. Evaluation of kidney toxicity using
NAMs includes a wide array of endpoints which include biomarkers of
renal toxicity including urinary total protein, kidney injury molecule-1
(KIM-1), clusterin, β2-microglobulin (β2-MG), cystatin C (CysC), trefoil
factor-3 (TFF-3), renal papillary antigen-1 (RPA-1) and albumin. The
measurement of cell viability, LDH, GSH and ATP can also be used for
studying renal toxicity<sup>24</sup>. We have identified 8 industry
players in the context of kidney NAMs which have been listed in Table
3. 

The regulatory guidelines like ICH S7A outline the requirements for
safety evaluation emphasizing the kidney toxicity endpoints in
preclinical studies and support the usage of NAMs where
validated<sup>25</sup>.

A study by Kaluzhny et al showed that EpiKidney from MatTek Lifesciences
can mimic human kidney. EpiKidney consists of human primary proximal
tubular epithelial cells. It expresses the markers for renal clearance,
secretion, and reabsorption. Therefore, it can be used to predict human
nephrotoxicity<sup>26</sup>. Another study from Mou et al, 2024 showed
that they have successfully built a kidney glomerulus-on-chip that
mimics glomerular morphology and barrier function using biomimetic
ultrathin membrane and human-induced pluripotent stem cells from Emulate
Bio. This chip can be used for modelling human kidney specific
morphogenesis and function<sup>27</sup>. Somova et al in 2024 developed
a renal cell carcinoma model using TissUse Humimic platform which can
mimic the interplay between healthy and malignant human tissue. They
co-cultured healthy human renal proximal tubule epithelial cells and
renal cell carcinoma spheroids. This co-culture system enabled them to
study host-tumor interactions<sup>28</sup>.These studies reveal that NAM
technologies can be used for drug-induced nephrotoxicity screening and
studying the PKPD of the drug.

Currently, a major factor which limits the adoption of invitro methods
for renal toxicity is the lack of validated in vitro cell models of the
kidney. Secondly there is a lack of robust markers of kidney toxicity
studies by in vitro methods<sup>29</sup>. A well-established indigenous
biobank which can provide validated human primary proximal tubular
epithelial cells, human-induced pluripotent stem cells and renal cell
lines can accelerate the development of adoption of NAMs by Indian
pharmaceutical companies.

**4.3.3. Respiratory toxicity testing**

Respiratory toxicity testing is essential for evaluating the safety of
drugs, chemicals, and environmental pollutants that may impact lung
function. The *invivo* end points used to detect lung toxicity are
respiratory rate and respiratory function (e.g., tidal volume or
hemoglobin oxygen saturation). These include evaluations of both the
total respiratory system and the mechanical properties of the lung (ICH
S7A guidelines). But animal models fail to accurately predict lung
toxicity of drugs. Animal models differ from humans in the deposition
pattern of drugs and also in pathways by which the drug is cleared from
the lungs. This species-specific difference results in drug failure
during the drug development process<sup>30</sup>. The use of NAMs can
provide an accurate alternative to animal testing. These
*invitro* techniques mimic in vivo lung structure & function and are of
human origin. *Invitro* air-liquid interface (ALI) cell culture models
can potentially be used to assess inhalation toxicology endpoints like
percentage cytotoxicity and release of cytokines (IL-6, IL-8)/chemokines
(MCP-1/CCL2, CXCL1/Groα, CXCL2/Groβ) and trans-epithelial electrical
resistance (TEER)<sup>12</sup>. The use of NAMs in respiratory toxicity
testing is increasingly supported by regulatory guideline ICH S7A which
emphasizes the importance of safety evaluations that consider
respiratory system toxicity during non-clinical studies<sup>25</sup>.

We identified 14 global industry players in the context of respiratory
NAMs which have been listed in Table 4 (The detailed list containing
details of the respective companies, the NAMs that are being used to
study the tissue specific toxicity, the in vitro end points being
studied, the application of NAMs, the type of cells being used and the
list of corresponding publications. is provided in Supplementary
document 1). 

AlveoliX’s Lung-on-Chip has been widely used by academicians and CROs
for testing inhalation toxicity. Sengupta et al in 2022 for the first
time reported a primary derived alveolar epithelial cell line
on-chip which represented both Alveolar Type 1 and 2 characteristics.
This AXlung-on-chip from AlveoliX can be used for inhalation toxicity of
drugs and xenobiotics characterization<sup>31</sup>. Another study
conducted by Cochin et al in 2021 used MucilAir™ from Epithelix to show
that hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin cannot be used as antiviral
drugs against SARS-CoV-2 viral infections. MucilAir™ consists of Basal
cells (progenitor cells), Goblet cells (mucus producing cells), Ciliated
cells (with active cilia). This indicated that MucilAir™ can be used as
a reliable model system to mimic human lung and can be used to study
respiratory disease pathologies<sup>32</sup>. Burla et al in 2024 showed
that ALIsens<sup>® </sup> (consisting of Alveolar cells) from
Invitrolize can identify respiratory toxic compounds. In this study they
have also identified   thymic stromal lymphopoietin receptor (TSLPr)
cell surface marker as a biomarker for predicting respiratory
hazards<sup>33</sup>. Wallace et al in 2023 has used human and rat
EpiAirway™ consisting tracheal/bronchial epithelial cells available as a
co-culture system with normal stromal fibroblasts, for studying the
inhalation toxicity of therapeutic drugs. The end points for toxicity
measurements were viability by MTT assay, epithelial barrier integrity
(TEER, transepithelial electrical resistance) and tissue morphology.
Their study led to the conclusion that both rat and human EpiAirway™
respond similarly to drugs<sup>34</sup>. Lung-on-chip from Emulate Bio
has also been used extensively. A study conducted by Si et al in 2021
utilized the lung-on-chip from Emulate Bio which consists of epithelial
and lung-specific endothelial cells to identify antiviral therapeutics
and prophylactics<sup>35</sup>. These various studies indicate that NAMs
have a potential for screening drugs for inhalation toxicity.

In order to facilitate adoption of these invitro methods for inhalation
toxicity prediction, the cell culture should be done in ALI conditions,
i.e., cultures where cells are grown in direct contact with air
<sup>30</sup>. Also, there should be an indigenous source of
validated primary derived alveolar epithelial cell, basal cells
(progenitor cells), goblet cells (mucus producing cells), ciliated cells
(with active cilia), tracheal/bronchial epithelial cells and stromal
fibroblasts cells to catalyze the adoption of NAMs by Indian
pharmaceutical companies.

**4.3.4. Central Nervous System (CNS) toxicity testing**

CNS toxicity testing is a critical component in evaluating the safety of
pharmaceutical compounds particularly those that cross or interact with
the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The *invivo* endpoints used to detect
neurotoxicity of compounds include evaluation of motor activity,
behavioral changes, coordination, sensory/motor reflex responses and
body temperature (ICHS7A guidelines). But these animal models do not
accurately predict human disease. Specific differences in blood-brain
barrier (BBB) permeability, drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters
can lead to differences in drug exposure in the human brain compared to
animals<sup>36</sup>**.** NAMs can be used for replicating CNS-specific
toxicity thereby providing alternatives to traditional *invivo* methods.
The *invitro* end points include measurement of neurodevelopmental
process at cellular level (e.g., proliferation, migration, neurite
growth, synaptogenesis, myelination, apoptosis) and nervous system
connectivity (e.g. structural, neurochemical, neurophysiological). The
key guidelines include ICH S7A<sup>25</sup> and OECD TG 426 which
provides guidelines for Developmental Neurotoxicity (DNT) invitro
battery testing<sup>37</sup>. 

In our study 20 global industry players in NAMs were identified in the
context of CNS which are listed in Table 5 (The detailed list containing
details of the respective companies, the NAMs that are being used to
study the tissue specific toxicity, the *invitro* end points being
studied, the application of NAMs, the type of cells being used and the
list of corresponding publications. is provided in Supplementary
document 1). 

A number of studies have been conducted globally using AxoSim’s 3D
technologies. For example in a study conducted by Zhong et al in 2020,
they used the brain spheroids consisting of neurons, astrocytes and
microglia to detect the developmental neurotoxicity of Paroxetine which
is a Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor<sup>38</sup>. In another
study by Gabriel-Segard et al in 2023, used 2D- invitro iPSC culture
from Neurosetta to build a microfluidic technology to model bilateral
neuro-immunological communication. This model can be used to test drug
compounds along the gut-brain axis<sup>39</sup>. Another commercial
player is NETRI which produces 3D- Compartmentalized GABAergic &
Glutamatergic Neurons which can be used for detecting developmental
neurotoxicity and drug screening. In 2020, Fantuzzoa et al in his study
showed that these neurons can be used for drug screening
applications<sup>40</sup>.Such different studies indicate that these
NAMs can be used for studying developmental neurotoxicity and functional
neuronal evaluations.

Though these NAMs are available globally but their adoption by Indian
pharma companies is a challenge. Establishment of an indigenous biobank
which can provide verified iPSC derived neuronal cells, astrocytes and
microglial cells will help to accelerate these NAMs adoption.

**4.3.5. Cardiotoxicity testing**

Cardiotoxicity of drugs remains a serious concern in drug development
and chemical safety evaluation as adverse effects on the heart can lead
to severe health outcomes including arrhythmias, myocardial dysfunction
and heart failure<sup>41</sup>.A  large number of *invivo* tests are
routinely   performed to evaluate cardiotoxicity. The *invivo* endpoints
include measurement of blood pressure, heart rate, ECG and follow up
parameters include cardiac output, ventricular contractility and
vascular resistance (ICHS7A, ICHS7B guidelines). But species differences
lead to increasing chance of false positive or false negative prediction
of patient responses<sup>42</sup>. Therefore, NAMs can be used as an
alternative to animal testing offering human-relevant insights into
cardiac function, electrophysiology and cellular mechanisms of toxicity.
The *invitro* endpoints include measurement of pro-arrythmia risk by
delayed ventricular potential. This can be measured by measuring
the ionic currents in cardiomyocytes, action potential parameters in
isolated cardiac preparations and QT interval. Invitro IKr assays,
ventricular repolarization assays and *invitro* electrophysiology
studies like cardiomyocyte calcium handling transients, contractility,
calcium homeostasis are also measured as *invitro* parameters for
testing of cardiotoxicity (ICHS7B guidelines).The use of NAMs in
cardiotoxicity testing is increasingly supported by key guidelines which
include ICH S7A and S7B which focus on evaluating the potential for
delayed ventricular repolarization (QT interval prolongation) and
associated risks of arrhythmias. It supports the use of *invitro* and
*insilico* models for early hazard identification<sup>25,43</sup>. An 
initiative to accelerate use of invitro methods for cardiotoxicity
prediction is the FDA Comprehensive In Vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CiPA)
which recommends combining ion channel assays, hiPSC-derived
cardiomyocytes, and in silico models to predict proarrhythmic risk,
enhancing the reliability of non-animal testing approaches<sup>44</sup>.

 (<u><https://www.fda.gov/drugs/regulatory-science-action/impact-story-improved-assessment-cardiotoxic-risk-drug-candidates-comprehensive-in-vitro-proarrhythmia>). </u>

We identified 16 key industry players for cardiac NAMs which have been
listed in Table 6 (The detailed list containing details of the
respective companies, the NAMs that are being used to study the tissue
specific toxicity, the in vitro end points being studied, the
application of NAMs, the type of cells being used and the list of
corresponding publications. is provided in Supplementary document 1).

In 2024, Axion Biosystems launched the new [Maestro
Volt](https://www.axionbiosystems.com/products/mea/maestro-volt)™
which serves as an affordable benchtop microelectrode array (MEA)
system. It can therefore meet the demands of academic labs with limited
budgets. In the field of cardiac NAMs, Axol Biosciences have also made a
significant progress. In a study conducted in 2021 by Kanade at al, they
used cardiomyocytes from Axol biosciences to determine the effect of
hypothermia on mechano-physiology and electrophysiology of
heart<sup>45</sup>. Another global player, Ncardia in January 2025
announced the launch of Ncyte<sup>®</sup> Heart in a Box which is a
robust platform to study heart development. These studies imply that
NAMs can be applied in the context of drug-induced cardiotoxicity
screening, investigating cellular and molecular pathways involved in
cardiotoxicity. 

In order to facilitate the adoption of these NAMs by Indian
pharmaceutical companies, there should be an indigenous source of
validated cell lines and iPSC derived cardiomyocytes.

**4.3.6. Intestinal toxicity testing**

The intestinal tract plays a critical role in nutrient absorption,
metabolism and barrier defense making it highly susceptible to toxicity
from pharmaceuticals, chemicals and environmental agents. Animal models
are used to study intestinal toxicity endpoints like gastric secretion,
gastrointestinal injury potential, bile secretion, transit time
*invivo*, ileal contraction in vitro, gastric pH measurement **(**ICHS7A
guidelines). The *invivo* testing methods are costly and not
translationally relevant due to species differences leading to failure
of clinical trials. NAMs can provide an alternative *invitro* platform
to test drugs for intestinal toxicity. The endpoints NAMs can be used to
study are barrier function, drug absorption, metabolism and drug
transport. Global regulatory guidelines that support the integration of
NAMs in intestinal toxicity studies are ICH S7A which emphasizes the
importance of safety evaluations that consider intestinal toxicity
during non-clinical studies<sup>25</sup>.

We identified 8 global industry players for intestinal NAMs which are
listed in Table 7 (The detailed list containing details of the
respective companies, the NAMs that are being used to study the tissue
specific toxicity, the in vitro end points being studied, the
application of NAMs, the type of cells being used and the list of
corresponding publications. is provided in Supplementary document 1).

The RepliGut systems consisting of human primary intestinal epithelial
cells from Altis Biosystems has been used extensively for studying drug
metabolism, e.g., in 2019, study conducted by Speer at al used this
technology to study the pharmacokinetics of drugs<sup>46</sup>. Ozkan et
al, 2024 used colon-on-chip from Emulate Bio which consists of
biopsy-derived colonoids and colonic endothelial cells to study the
drivers of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) where they studied the
effect of carcinogens on colon cancer progression and effect of female
hormones on IBD syndrome<sup>47</sup>. Another study by Simon et al,
2019 studied the effect of interleukin-6 on the drug metabolizing
enzymes and ABC transporters using EpiIntestinal™- 3D (consists of
enterocytes, Paneth cell, M cells, tuft cells and intestinal stem cells)
from MatTek Lifesciences<sup>48</sup>.These studies proved that these
alternative technologies can be applied for drug-induced toxicity
screening and pharmacokinetics of drug.

Establishment of an indigenous cell repository to provide as a source
for validated primary intestinal epithelial cells, enterocytes, Paneth
cells, intestinal stem cells and colonic endothelial cells is crucial to
accelerate the adoption of NAMs by Indian pharmaceutical companies.

studying intestinal toxicity.

**4.3.7. Dermal toxicity testing**

The use of animal testing like the Draize skin test for testing of skin
irritation has limitations like a large variation in test results and
species-difference between rabbit and human<sup>2</sup>. Alternatives to
animal testing of dermal toxicity are designed to measure a range of
biological endpoints which are critical to understand the effects of
chemicals and drugs on human skin. These include evaluating skin
irritation, corrosion and sensitization. These endpoints can be
validated by measuring cell viability, histopathology and cytokine
release. International regulatory agencies have established
comprehensive guidelines to ensure the reliability and validity of
non-animal testing methods. OECD guidelines like OECD TG 431 and TG 439
permit the use of NAMs for chemical testing for invitro skin corrosion,
sensitization and irritation. OECD has validated five skin models:
SkinEthic RHE, Episkin, EpiDerm<sup>TM</sup>, EPI-MODEl-24, and
epiCS®<sup>9</sup>. 

We have identified 23 global industry players in dermal NAMs. List of
global industry players in dermal NAMs are listed in Table 8.

A study by Fusco et al states that OECD TG 439 validated SkinEthic™
Reconstructed human Epidermis (RhE) consisting of human keratinocytes
can also be used for graphene-based materials (GBM). SkinEthic™ was used
in this study to predict the skin irritation potential of GBMs using MTT
assay and measuring cytokine release like IL-6, IL-8,
IL-1α<sup>49</sup>. In a study by Kojima et al in 2012, 25 chemicals
were tested for their dermal toxicity using LabCyte EPI-MODEL24
consisting of human epidermal keratinocytes. MTT assay and IL-1α
measurements were done using the model and the data generated was
accurate and highly reproducible between different
laboratories<sup>50</sup>. Similarly, the skin irritation test (SIT)
method for epiCS® was done for substances to distinguish them as
irritants and non-irritants by exposing the tissues to the substance for
20 mins followed by a MTT assay. The validation of the SIT method was
done by EURL-ECVAM and was incorporated into OECD TG 439<sup>51</sup>.
Since the RhE closely mimics the histological, morphological,
biochemical and physiological properties of the upper parts of the human
skin, i.e. the epidermis, these invitro models can provide to be an
alternative to animal testing while ensuring high compliance with global
regulatory standards. They are important for the development of safer
cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. RhE models can be used for measuring in
vitro drug release (IVRT) and in vitro drug permeation testing (IVPT) in
pharma industries<sup>52</sup>**.**

In order to ensure adoption of these NAMs in the Indian pharmaceutical
context, there should be collaborative work among academia, industry,
and regulatory agencies in the pharmaceutical community<sup>53</sup>.
Also, establishment of biobanks which can provide a source of human
epidermal keratinocytes and primary dermal cells can also act as the
driving force to facilitate the adoption of these NAMs.

**4.3.8. Ocular toxicity testing**

Evaluating the safety of drugs and chemicals on eye is essential as
these may come into direct or indirect contact with our eyes. The
*invivo* models are used to measure endpoints like ocular corrosion,
irritation, sensitivity, absorption and phototoxicity. Parameters used
to measure ocular corrosion and irritation are tests that evaluates the
degree of eye irritation or corrosion by scoring lesions on the cornea,
iris, and conjunctiva. The animal models perform poorly to translate to
human studies. For example, Draize test is not reliable because of the
fundamental anatomical differences between the human and rabbit eye.
This highlights the disadvantages of in-vivo test over invitro
alternative. (Stephen R. Kaufman, M.D.). Thus, we should encourage the
usage of vitro technologies as an alternative to the *invivo* tests.
NAMs can act as robust tools for ocular safety assessments offering
human-relevant insights into toxicity mechanisms while reducing reliance
on animal testing. The *invitro* endpoints of ocular corrosion an
irritation can be measured using cell viability assays (MTT assays).
These technologies can be used for evaluating the irritancy potential of
pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and industry chemicals. The regulatory
guidelines that promote alternative methods include OECD TG 496, 498
which specifies the use of reconstructed human corneal epithelial
models, such as EpiOcular™ and SkinEthic™ HCE for assessing eye
irritation and serious eye damage<sup>54,55</sup>.

In our study we have identified 7 global industry players in the field
of ocular NAMs which have been listed in Table 9 (The detailed list
containing details of the respective companies, the NAMs that are being
used to study the tissue specific toxicity, the in vitro end points
being studied, the application of NAMs, the type of cells being used and
the list of corresponding publications. is provided in Supplementary
document 1).

In 2009, Pauly et al, studied the toxic effect of Benzalkonium Chloride
on eye using EpiSkin’s SkinEthicTM HCE - Human Corneal
Epithelium<sup>56</sup> consisting of human corneal epithelium. Lebrun
labs in 2019 conducted a study using OptiSafeTM EIT3to develop a
prediction model for classifying irritants on the basis of in vitro
histopathology studies. They used 16 different chemicals based on
Globally Harmonized System (GHS) and U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency  (EPA) classification systems<sup>57</sup>.Therefore, these
technologies can be applied for eye irritancy testing, drug-induced
ocular toxicity testing and permeability and absorption studies.

Establishment of an indigenous cell repository which will provide
validated human corneal epithelial cells is crucial to accelerate the
adoption of NAMs by Indian pharmaceutical companies.

studying ocular toxicity

Based on the analysis of industry- players involved in NAMs, we have
quantified the presence of industry players within the context of
tissue-specific toxicity studies. Of the 122 NAMs evaluated, the highest
number are utilized for studying dermal toxicity (23) and hepatic
toxicity (26). In addition to these, NAMs are also employed for toxicity
assessments of other tissues, including ocular, renal, respiratory,
intestinal, central nervous system (CNS), and cardiac toxicity, as
summarized in Table 10 and illustrated in Figure 3.

**4.4.1. Rare diseases**

Rare diseases present an interesting area to use human-relevant
technologies as several challenges are associated with rare disease
therapeutics, with animal models either unavailable or often failing as
preclinical test systems and providing limited insights regarding their
biological mechanisms. Currently, there are no approved treatments for
95% of rare diseases. NAMs are being used in two domains of drug
development for rare diseases: nonclinical research (efficacy testing)
and precision medicine (Table 11).

**4.4.2. Cancer**

1.  **Colorectal cancer**

Using a large biobank of patient-derived colorectal cancer organoids
(CRC), MCLA-158, a bispecific antibody binding epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) and leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled
receptor 5 (LGR5), was identified as the most effective antibody as it
could reliably discriminate between cancerous and healthy cells. Based
on the data from human-derived cancer organoids, the compound went from
bench to bedside in just 3 years (Clinical Trial No:
[<u>NCT03526835</u>](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03526835);
[<u>https://www.cancercarenorthwest.com/clinical-research/nct03526835</u>](https://www.cancercarenorthwest.com/clinical-research/nct03526835)
)

2.  **Small cell lung carcinoma**

Amivantamab is a bispecific antibody against EGFR and the
mesenchymal-epithelial transition receptor, and its efficacy was
preclinically tested in patient-derived cells and organoids that
harbour *EGFR* Exon20ins mutation<sup>62</sup>. The standard drugs,
including Tyrosine kinases, have a poor prognosis for this mutation. The
results were replicated in clinical trials (Clinical Trial No.:
[<u>NCT04538664</u>](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04538664)),
and amivantamab was eventually approved by the EMA for the treatment of
non-small cell lung cancer.

3.  **Breast Cancer**

Currently, 36 trials are underway that are using patient-derived
organoids to verify the effectiveness, feasibility and consistency of
the PDO model in predicting treatment, and establish an evaluation
system for treatment plans to help precision treatment of advanced
breast cancer. Examples of five such trials have been provided for
reference in Table 12.

organoids

**4.5*. In-silico* approaches to NAMs **

In order to reduce the animals usage in the drug discovery and
development, 3Rs principle was introduced by Russell and Birch in late
1950’s that focused on replacement, reduction, refinement of animal
use<sup>60</sup>. While the approaches of reduction and refinement have
been practiced widely since last few decades, the concept of replacement
now being increasingly used to promote the complete abolition of all
animal based research<sup>61</sup>. The US FDA modernization act passed
on Oct 2022. This act removed the animal testing as a requirement for
new drug applications (NDA) and is considered as a notable step to
replace animal testing with cutting-edge technologies, cell-based
assays, human organ chips and computational modelling. 

In silico approaches or computational tools in the recent times enabled
the simulation of entire drug discovery and development scenario. These
approaches have demonstrated applications in both preclinical and
clinical development scenarios. In the preclinical space, in silico
approaches are used to predict drug safety, toxicity, efficacy, suitable
formulation selection for toxicity studies and PK-PD correlations. In
clinical development scenarios, in silico approaches are applied to
simulate clinical scenarios such as clinical trial outcome,
bioequivalence and bioavailability predictions, drug-drug
interactions<sup>62,63</sup>, optimization of formulation to achieve
desired clinical response. Approaches such as physiologically based
pharmacokinetic modeling (PBPK) and physiologically based
biopharmaceutics modeling (PBBM) enabled clinical development and
transformation by reduction in human clinical studies and trials to a
greater extent<sup>64,65</sup>. Regulatory agencies such as US
FDA<sup>66</sup>, and EMA<sup>67</sup> now have dedicated guidance
documents encouraging the sponsors to use these approaches widely at new
drug and generic product development scenarios. 

In the era of preclinical development, the application of in silico
approaches are multi-fold. In silico simulation approaches can be used
to predict the toxicity resulting from the new chemical entity. For
example, early prediction of cardiotoxicity is essential for drug
development. while the use of animal models raise concerns about ethical
and translational capabilities<sup>68</sup>, human based computational
models were reported. In silico approaches combining computational and
experimental methods<sup>69</sup> can be used to predict clinical risk
of drug induced arrhythmias based on ion channel information. A deep
machine learning approach has been reported in the recent times
that<sup>70</sup> can predict the prolongation of QT interval that can
lead to fatal cardiotoxicity that may result in withdrawal of drugs from
the market, if identified lately. Other models to predict hepatotoxicity
have also been reported in the literature wherein the models built on
complex pathology, hepatotoxicity end points was able to predict
hepatotoxicity early thereby enabling early flagging of molecules
exhibiting such risk patterns<sup>71</sup>. Similarly, computational
models also have been reported in the literature for prediction of
efficacy (e.g. in the field of Cancer)<sup>72</sup> based on molecular,
cellular and clinical data thereby enabling selection of appropriate
molecules for drug development. Such models, when validated against
clinical data, becomes robust and powerful tools to reduce the extent of
preclinical testing in the drug discovery and development program. 

Other potential applications of in silico tools in reduction of animal
testing is the application of quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) in
the drug development. The QSP models are the computational tools that
describe dynamic interactions between drug and pathophysiology to
understand how the system works
([<u>https://www.allucent.com/resources/blog/benefits-and-uses-qsp-drug-development</u>](https://www.allucent.com/resources/blog/benefits-and-uses-qsp-drug-development)).
QSP models are used to predict the exposure in preclinical species, to
perform interspecies scaling, estimating first in human (FIH) exposures
and establishment of in vitro in vivo extrapolation approaches. QSP was
found to have significant role in preclinical stage for oncology
molecules to increase the probability of success of proof of concept
(POC) studies when applied from early preclinical stage<sup>73</sup>.
Such approaches can reduce the use of preclinical studies and animal
requirement for the efficacy studies. Apart from the clinical
pharmacological studies, in silico approaches can be widely used to
support formulation development for preclinical studies, food effect
evaluation, impact of acid reducing agents etc., thereby avoiding the
requirement of preclinical studies<sup>74</sup>. 

This summary and assessment clearly indicate the applications of in
silico modeling in reducing the preclinical efficacy, toxicity, ADME
characterization and formulation selections.

**4.6. Global regulatory requirements**

Global regulatory agencies like FDA, OECD and ICH support the adoption
and usage of NAMs. The FDA regulations under IND (21 CFR 312.23) and NDA
(21 CFR 314.50) allow the use of non-animal methods like in-vitro assays
for pharmacology and toxicology data submissions. The FDA and ICH
guidelines (Table 14) encourage the use of alternative methods aligned
with the 3Rs principles<sup>75</sup>. OECD guidelines support invitro
methods for ocular and skin irritation tests (Table 15). Specific ICH
guidelines such as S5(R3) and S10 describe the use of in vitro methods
for toxicity evaluations. These guidelines support the development and
regulatory adoption of NAMs for drug safety evaluations. The FDA
supports integrating NAMs into pharmaceutical development, provided
these methods are scientifically validated for their intended context.
Collaboration between sponsors, the FDA, and global partners is critical
for advancing the regulatory acceptance of NAMs. The FDA emphasizes
flexibility in adopting new methods, ensuring they meet safety and
efficacy standards.

The primary regulatory frameworks in NAMs are driven globally. This
section primarily focuses on the global landscape and industry-players
in NAMs to provide a deeper understanding of evolving technologies.
Understanding the global regulatory trends in NAMs will help the Indian
pharma companies to implement these technologies in compliance with the
international standards.

From the PBPK modeling perspective, regulatory agencies such as EMA and
USFDA have come up with detailed regulatory guidelines. EMA has issued a
guidance on reporting of PBPK modeling and simulation results (effective
in 2019\[SK1\] )<sup>67</sup>, which talks about submitting PBPK models
in regulatory applications. This document aimed to clarify which
supportive data are expected in order to qualify a PBPK platform for
intended application. Recently (Feb 2025), EMA<sup>76</sup> \[SK2\] also
came up with a concept paper on reporting of mechanistic models used in
model informed drug development. The PBBM guidance issued by USFDA in
2\[SK3\] 020<sup>66</sup> focusses on general recommendations regarding
development, evaluation and use of PBPK for biopharmaceutics
applications for both NDA and ANDAs. This guidance applies for orally
administered drug products and talks about evaluating the impact of
various biopharmaceutics attributes on the pharmacokinetic performance
of dosage forms. Most recently, the harmonized guidance (ICH M15\[SK4\]
)<sup>77</sup> has also been issued that details the requirements of
model informed drug development. Overall, the issuance of specific
guidelines from regulatory agencies encourages the use of physiological
models in both new drugs as well as generic product development.

**4.7 Current regulatory expectations in India**

Clinical trials in India are governed by the Drugs and Cosmetics Act of
1940, the Medical Council of India Act of 1956, the Central Council for
Indian Medicine Act of 1970 and the Guidelines for Exchange of
Biological Material (MOH order, 1997). Researchers seeking to conduct a
clinical trial in the country must obtain permission from the Drugs
Controller General India (DCGI), obtain approval from the Ethics
Committee established under Drugs and Cosmetics Rules and register on
the ICMR-maintained website
**(**[<u>https://iaspoint.com/india-amends-rules-to-allow-non-animal-drug-testing/</u>](https://iaspoint.com/india-amends-rules-to-allow-non-animal-drug-testing/)**).**

The government of India has passed the New Drugs and Clinical Trial
Rules (2023) whose objective is to replace the use of animals in
research particularly in drug testing. The amendment permits researchers
to use non-animal and human-relevant methods including technologies
like 3D organoids, organs-on-chip, and advanced computational methods
instead of traditional animal methods to test the safety and efficacy of
new drugs. Also, these rules require that any CRO conducting a clinical
trial or bioavailability/bioequivalence study of new drugs or
investigational drugs in human subjects must first obtain registration
from the Central Licensing Authority before proceeding with the study.

**(**[<u>https://www.biopharmaboardroom.com/news/14/743/india-takes-historic-step-towards-eliminating-animal-testing-in-drug-development.html</u>](https://www.biopharmaboardroom.com/news/14/743/india-takes-historic-step-towards-eliminating-animal-testing-in-drug-development.html)**)**

**4.8 Challenges **

Despite the readiness of these NAMs for implementation, several
challenges hinder their adoption in the Indian context:

1.  **Scientific Robustness and Validation:**

There is a lack of proper cell repositories in the country. Therefore,
it is critical to establish biobanks or cell repositories within India.
Multiple stakeholders whom we consulted from different fields like skin,
ocular, liver, lungs, cancer, intestine, brain and cardiac research have
emphasized on the importance of having indigenous quality-controlled
primary cells, cell lines, or immortalized cell lines. Organizations
such as Axol Biosciences
([<u>https://axolbio.com/</u>](https://axolbio.com/) ), Cellular
Dynamics
([<u>https://www.fujifilmcdi.com/</u>](https://www.fujifilmcdi.com/)),
and ATCC ([<u>https://www.atcc.org/</u>](https://www.atcc.org/))  offer
valuable  examples and similar infrastructure must be developed in
India. This will ensure rapid deployment and cost-effective construction
of both 2D and 3D models subject to appropriate intellectual property
considerations.

Robust international guidelines for *in-silico* modeling in drug
toxicity and efficacy studies have facilitated its adoption by companies
globally. Regulatory bodies such as the FDA, have proposed specific
frameworks for using in silico data in drug evaluations<sup>78</sup>.
The Indian scientific community must adopt and adapt these guidelines to
establish credibility and enable seamless integration of in-silico
models into the drug development pipeline.

1.  **Economic Considerations:**

The adoption of NAMs within India face economic challenges. This
includes high costs associated with importing the technology and
potential intellectual property constraints. These problems highlight
the need to develop similar technologies domestically. This will require
strategic planning, identification of specialized laboratories with the
required expertise and targeted funding. 

**4.9. Relevance in India**

Though the global scenario for NAMs usage is growing, the Indian
pharmaceutical industry is lagging behind. Therefore, Indian
pharmaceutical industry should catalyze the adoption of NAMs through
prioritizing its usage. The major step towards that will be the
indigenous establishment of a high quality and well-validated cell
repository for primary cells ,cell lines and cells from different
genetic backgrounds. The availability of well validated primary cells is
crucial for drug-screening. Indian users are currently importing the
cell lines from outside which increases the cost of invitro techniques.
Developing an indigenous cell repository will reduce the cost as well as
the time constraint. Also, sourcing the cell culture lab-wares, media
components and reagents from outside India is a challenge due to high
cost and logistical challenges which can be overcome by indigenous
production of media components. An effort towards development of an
indigenous production house which includes production of media
components will enhance India’s research capabilities in drug
development. India lacks the awareness for NAM technologies. Organizing
workshops, training initiatives, knowledge-sharing platforms can help
the Indian pharma industry to incorporate NAMs based technologies in
their drug development pipelines. Building public-private partnerships
can help to bridge the funding gap for Indian pharma companies and
academia. Grants from Indian government agencies like DBT, CSIR, BIRAC
can help to prioritize NAM development in India. A large population in
India is affected with diseases like cancer, diabetes and respiratory
disorders. Therefore, using NAMs like 3D spheroid cultures or patient
derived iPSC models can be used in efficacy testing of drugs to cure
these complex diseases. 

**4.10. Key Recommendations**

**4.10.1. Opportunities for waiver of toxicology studies**

**  **

**  **

Based on our analysis of the 122 evaluated NAMs, the NAMs related to
liver toxicity have the highest technological readiness level. Notably,
Liver-on-chip from Emulate Bio is part of the FDA’s Innovative Science
and Technology Approaches for New Drugs (ISTAND) Pilot Program and is in
the advanced stage of evaluation and approval. However, no NAMs have
currently received full regulatory acceptance. Therefore, at this stage,
no opportunities are identified for waiver of toxicology studies.

**4.10.2. Opportunities for reduction of animals in non-clinical
studies**

Our analysis of the 124 NAMs revealed that the highest number of NAMs
are utilized for studying dermal toxicity (23) and hepatic toxicity
(26). In addition to these, NAMs are also employed for toxicity
assessments of other tissues, including ocular, renal, respiratory,
intestinal, central nervous system (CNS), and cardiac toxicity, as
summarized in Table 10 and illustrated in Figure 3. 

Based on our classification of NAMs, NAMs with high TRL include two
liver NAMs: Liver-on-Chip by Emulate Bio and Liver Spheroids by
InSphero, and five skin NAMs: EPISKIN’s SkinEthic™ RHE**,**
EPISKIN™**,** SkinInVitro GmbH’s epiCS®**,** MatTek Lifesciences’
EpiDerm™**,** and J-Tec’s LabCyte EPI-MODEL-24™**.** 

The five skin NAMs have been validated by OECD Test Guidelines (TG) 431
and 439 for chemicals making them suitable for evaluating skin
irritation, corrosion, and sensitization. They have a high impact and
high complexity of adoption. Though the five skin NAMs are of high TRL
and are validated by OECD guidelines, they are less relevant in the
context of this study due to the limited use of topical drug
applications on the skin in toxicity testing. Additionally, most CROs
have already transitioned to in-vitro technologies for testing dermal
toxicity instead of in-vivo for chemicals. 

The liver NAMs are classified as high TRL since they have high impact in
terms of cost and animal reduction and also, cthey are widely being used
by pharma companies and CROs. The liver-on-chip model by Emulate Bio is
part of the FDA’s Innovative Science and Technology Approaches for New
Drugs (ISTAND) Pilot Program while InSphero’s 3D liver spheroids have
been utilized in collaboration with the U.S. FDA for liver toxicity
studies. These advanced TRL liver NAMs are particularly valuable for
assessing hepatotoxicity and drug-induced liver injury (DILI), offering
significant potential for integration into drug development processes
within the Indian pharmaceutical sector. Therefore, we recommend the
adoption of these high TRL liver NAMs in the Indian pharmaceutical
context.

Apart from the liver, NAMs with lower TRL, particularly for the kidney,
lungs and heart require urgent focus. Technologies such as 2D invitro
cell culture models for lungs, 2D iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes and
insilico cardiotoxicity prediction tools have low complexity of adoption
and high impact in terms of cost reduction. Therefore, the Indian pharma
industry should move towards adopting these NAMs in future.

**4.10.3. Opportunities for replacement of animals in non-clinical
studies**

Currently, no opportunities are identified for the replacement of
animals with NAMs. There are no existing NAMs with immediate regulatory
approval. Therefore, it cannot be immediately integrated into regulatory
frameworks as replacements for key animal safety studies, as only
qualified models are permitted for use. However, in-vitro and in-silico
methods can be used in the initial phases of the drug discovery pipeline
for lead identification to reduce the number of animal studies
conducted.
