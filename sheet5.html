        <td>MatTek Life Sciences is at the forefront of tissue engineering technology and its lab-grown human tissues of the skin, eye, respiratory, and digestive systems are used worldwide as ethical and human-relevant alternatives to animal testing. MatTek tissues have unparalleled reproducibility and multiple regulatory acceptances and validations from organizations like the OECD, ISO, and US EPA to predict the irritation, corrosion, and photosensitivity potential of chemical, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and other skin care products. Our EpiDerm and EpiOcular models are validated by OECD as an alternative to animal testing, Skin irritation test OECD TG 439, skin corrosion test OECD TG 431, phototoxicity OECD TG 498, eye irritation test OECD TG 492, and biological evaluation of medical devices, ISO 10993-23. At the present time, MatTek IVLSL produces 8 models including EpiDerm, EpiDerm FT, EpiOcular, EpiIntestinal, EpiIntestinal FT, EpiAirway, EpiOral, and MelanoDerm. MatTek tissues are shipped weekly from its locations in the US and Europe via standard courier services and delivered ready to use with comprehensive testing results obtained in as little as 24 hours. With a footprint, a fraction of the size of animal testing, MatTek’s tissue technology offers a sustainable, streamlined testing option with reduced costs and timelines. In fulfillment of its mission to expand the accessibility of lab-grown human tissues, MatTek continues to grow its product offerings at all locations and enhance the complexity of existing organ models through robust R&amp;D. MatTek also supports researchers adopting the technology with comprehensive training and the highest-rated technical support in the industry. By providing a platform to obtain human-relevant data that is predictive of clinical outcomes, MatTek is helping researchers achieve their goals of producing reliable products and therapies for consumers and patients.</td>

When we first started out, the Japanese language did not even have a word for regenerative medicine. Projects in which patients&#39; cells were cultured to create the organs or tissue needed for transplants were unprecedented, and everything was done by trial and error. The present state of development of regenerative medicine in Japan rests on this history of trial and error during which we learned to overcome challenges.</td>

We offer one of the world’s most comprehensive portfolios of liver related products obtained from human and animal species like birds, fresh and seawater fish, rodents, and farm animals. Our liver cells have been successfully used for 2D and 3D cultures and microfluidic organ-on-a-chip applications. Our offering includes primary human and animal cells, liver subcellular fractions, ex vivo human and animal skin explants, blood cells, serum products, and consumables for applications in environmental toxicology, preclinical testing and drug development for human and animals. Products are manufactured in accordance with OECD test guidelines when applicable. We are GLP certified since 2006 and offer contract research studies for drug development and medical device testing. We have a validated technology platform to assay drug transporter activities in stably transfected HEK293-cells and primary hepatocytes. Since 2013 Primacyt serves as a reference laboratory for the validation of alternatives to animal experiments for the European Union.</td>

        <td>PKDERM is a French independent company that provides smart innovative in vitro solutions for safety and efficacy testing. Created in 2018, PKDERM relies on the expertise of more than 20 years of its founder, Dr. Hanan Osman-Ponchet. As a former leader in drug development for large pharmaceutical companies, PKDERM’s CEO has developed and tested many alternatives to animal experiment models allowing a reliable and secure evolution from in vivo experimentation to in vitro experimentation. The company is located in Grasse, in the south of France and aims to support partners in the area of cosmetic/personal care, dermatology, pharmaceutical, chemical, nutraceutical, and medical device industries. At PKDERM, we are familiar with an array of different assay systems to evaluate the safety and efficacy of new products. This allows us to work with our clients to determine the optimum assay that best fit their needs. Our acknowledged experience with our worldwide network of multidisciplinary partners enables us to rapidly support our customers confronted with new urgent testing needs.Our biological models include but not limited to: 2D culture of human skin cells (keratinocytes, fibroblasts, melanocytes), 3D human skin equivalent models, excised human skin, 2D and 3D human hepatocytes and 2D and 3D human lung models.</td>

        <td>MatTek Life Sciences is at the forefront of tissue engineering technology and its lab-grown human tissues of the skin, eye, respiratory, and digestive systems are used worldwide as ethical and human-relevant alternatives to animal testing. MatTek tissues have unparalleled reproducibility and multiple regulatory acceptances and validations from organizations like the OECD, ISO, and US EPA to predict the irritation, corrosion, and photosensitivity potential of chemical, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and other skin care products. Our EpiDerm and EpiOcular models are validated by OECD as an alternative to animal testing, Skin irritation test OECD TG 439, skin corrosion test OECD TG 431, phototoxicity OECD TG 498, eye irritation test OECD TG 492, and biological evaluation of medical devices, ISO 10993-23. At the present time, MatTek IVLSL produces 8 models including EpiDerm, EpiDerm FT, EpiOcular, EpiIntestinal, EpiIntestinal FT, EpiAirway, EpiOral, and MelanoDerm. MatTek tissues are shipped weekly from its locations in the US and Europe via standard courier services and delivered ready to use with comprehensive testing results obtained in as little as 24 hours. With a footprint, a fraction of the size of animal testing, MatTek’s tissue technology offers a sustainable, streamlined testing option with reduced costs and timelines. In fulfillment of its mission to expand the accessibility of lab-grown human tissues, MatTek continues to grow its product offerings at all locations and enhance the complexity of existing organ models through robust R&amp;D. MatTek also supports researchers adopting the technology with comprehensive training and the highest-rated technical support in the industry. By providing a platform to obtain human-relevant data that is predictive of clinical outcomes, MatTek is helping researchers achieve their goals of producing reliable products and therapies for consumers and patients.</td>

        <td>MatTek Life Sciences is at the forefront of tissue engineering technology and its lab-grown human tissues of the skin, eye, respiratory, and digestive systems are used worldwide as ethical and human-relevant alternatives to animal testing. MatTek tissues have unparalleled reproducibility and multiple regulatory acceptances and validations from organizations like the OECD, ISO, and US EPA to predict the irritation, corrosion, and photosensitivity potential of chemical, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and other skin care products. Our EpiDerm and EpiOcular models are validated by OECD as an alternative to animal testing, Skin irritation test OECD TG 439, skin corrosion test OECD TG 431, phototoxicity OECD TG 498, eye irritation test OECD TG 492, and biological evaluation of medical devices, ISO 10993-23. At the present time, MatTek IVLSL produces 8 models including EpiDerm, EpiDerm FT, EpiOcular, EpiIntestinal, EpiIntestinal FT, EpiAirway, EpiOral, and MelanoDerm. MatTek tissues are shipped weekly from its locations in the US and Europe via standard courier services and delivered ready to use with comprehensive testing results obtained in as little as 24 hours. With a footprint, a fraction of the size of animal testing, MatTek’s tissue technology offers a sustainable, streamlined testing option with reduced costs and timelines. In fulfillment of its mission to expand the accessibility of lab-grown human tissues, MatTek continues to grow its product offerings at all locations and enhance the complexity of existing organ models through robust R&amp;D. MatTek also supports researchers adopting the technology with comprehensive training and the highest-rated technical support in the industry. By providing a platform to obtain human-relevant data that is predictive of clinical outcomes, MatTek is helping researchers achieve their goals of producing reliable products and therapies for consumers and patients.</td>
