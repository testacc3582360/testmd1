Tailored assessment strategies: We use a breadth of commercial and non-commercial in vitro cell/tissue models spanning from the nasal to alveolar regions. As well as offering standard endpoints for in vitro toxicity (e.g. viability), we work alongside our clients to provide a range of relevant biochemical, morphological and functional assessments for toxicology and pharmacology to meet discovery and early product development needs. In addition to well-establishedepithelial endpoints, we are experts in the immunological responses of the airways in vitro and provide reliable and reproducible assessment packages for alveolar macrophages to support a more detailed mechanistic understanding of the safety and fate of inhaled substances in the lung. New in vitro models: We have developed our own in-house immunocompetent cell culture platforms of the alveoli for next generation inhalation risk assessment. ImmuPHAGETM is a robust and reproducible model of human alveolar-like macrophages which closely resembles in vivo morphology, biochemistry and functionality. Our patented system, ImmuLUNGTM is our human alveolar tissue model comprising alveolar epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages in co-culture, and able to provide a detailed understanding of immune and barrier responses in the airways. Animal product-free approaches: We are committed to reducing the quantity of animal-derived materials and enhancing the human relevance of in vitro cell culture assessment. We have established in-house animal product-free cell culture methodologies and assessment strategies which are at least equivalent to their animal product-containing counterpart and support clients in making their inhalation toxicity assessments more human relevant.”|info@immuone.com|alveolar macrophages|

The model correctly identifies the pro-haptens Ethylenediamine (EDA) and Piperazine (Pip) as respiratory sensitizers, chemicals which have been reported as false negative in other assays. The cell viability and the increased expression of the evaluated cell surface markers on DC-THP-1 cells demonstrates the capacity of the in vitro model to mimic the complexity of the alveolar barrier.|Distinguishing the respiratory sensitizers from irritants|Invitrolize is a spin-off from the Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology. We offer innovative 3D alveolar in vitro models for the prediction of chemical respiratory sensitizers and irritants. These in vitro models allow for the first time the in vitro prediction of respiratory sensitization under realistic exposure conditions. The model has been submitted to ECVAM for pre-validation. Our company and team come from the scientific & research sector, and we will continue to maintain the same high quality standards in everything we do. Our products deliver the most reliable results because we only focus on one thing, data. We want to lead the market in alveolar in vitro models for toxicological analysis and drug testing. To this end, we have the support of a network of research centres that allows us to continue carrying out research activities and improve our platform.|Arno Gutleb, https://www.linkedin.com/in/arno-gutleb-22220b4/,  (+) 352 621 403 203|Alveolar cells|
