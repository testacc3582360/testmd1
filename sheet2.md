Our in vitro testing system uses human cell models and enables artificial intelligence-based chemical screening with in-house developed software. Current procedures for regulatory risk assessment of chemicals and drugs regarding their potential to cause developmental neurotoxicity are time-consuming, expensive, and ethically controversial due to the use of laboratory animals. Because of species differences, they have limited predictivity for humans. Our testing strategy is faster, less expensive, animal-free, and the results of the testing have higher relevance to humans. We want to realize safe chemicals without animal testing. The DNTOX test system is a human cell-based testing system developed at the IUF – Leibniz Research Institute for Environmental Medicine in Düsseldorf, which in its entirety models necessary key processes of human brain development in vitro. The animal free testing system identifies substances disturbing neurodevelopmental processes and causing DNT cost- and time-efficiently, reliably, with higher relevance for humans.|Silke Beaucamp, https://www.linkedin.com/in/silke-beaucamp-b644a093/, info@dntox.de, tel: +49 211-16786306|Neurons|
